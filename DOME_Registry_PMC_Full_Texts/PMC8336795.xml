Metastatic lesions often exhibit a similar epithelial-like state to that of the primary tumour, in particular, by forming carcinoma cell clusters via E-cadherin-mediated junctional complexes. However, the factors enabling mesenchymal-like micrometastatic cells to resume growth and reacquire an epithelial phenotype in the target organ microenvironment remain elusive. In this study, we developed a workflow using image-based cell profiling and machine learning to examine morphological, contextual and molecular states of individual breast carcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231). MDA-MB-231 heterogeneous response to the host organ microenvironment was modelled by substrates with controllable stiffness varying from 0.2kPa (soft tissues) to 64kPa (bone tissues). We identified 3 distinct morphological cell types (morphs) varying from compact round-shaped to flattened irregular-shaped cells with lamellipodia, predominantly populating 2-kPa and &#x0003e;16kPa substrates, respectively. These observations were accompanied by significant changes in E-cadherin and vimentin expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the bone-mimicking substrate (64kPa) induced multicellular cluster formation accompanied by E-cadherin cell surface localisation. MDA-MB-231 cells responded to different substrate stiffness by morphological adaptation, changes in proliferation rate and cytoskeleton markers, and cluster formation on bone-mimicking substrate. Our results suggest that the stiffest microenvironment can induce MET.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process by which epithelial cells lose their cell polarity and cell-cell adhesion and gain migratory and invasive properties to become mesenchymal cells, is believed to play the key role in the initiation of the metastatic cascade. The ability of mesenchymal cells to survive, transform and establish colonies in distant organs is well known but not well understood. To gain insight into this process, we developed a workflow using machine learning and image analysis of cells to examine how morphology (or physical form and structure) and biochemical properties of individual (triple negative) breast carcinoma cells vary in response to their interaction with a substrate of variable stiffness. We found that mesenchymal breast cancer cells responded to different substrate stiffness by morphological adaptation, changes in proliferation rate and cytoskeleton markers such as cell-cell adhesion protein E-cadherin. Surprisingly, the cell properties on the stiffest tested substrate that mimicked bone stiffness changed dramatically&#x02013;they formed multicellular clusters with distinct E-cadherin localisation at the cell-cell adhesion surfaces. Our results suggest that the stiffest microenvironment can induce cell transitioning from mesenchymal to epithelial cell phenotype.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

About 15% of all invasive breast cancers classified as triple negative breast carcinoma (TNBC) are characterised by the lack of estrogen and progesterone receptors and HER2 amplification. TNBC are not responsive to current endocrine and other targeted therapies limiting the treatment options to surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It has been shown that TNBC patients have a higher probability of recurrence and distant relapse during the first five years compared to other types of breast cancer [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and shorter post-recurrence survival [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanisms of TNBC metastasis is crucial to improve the treatment outcomes.</p><p>One of the viable hypotheses relevant to TNBC metastasis relate to organotropic metastasis and is originated from the Paget&#x02019;s &#x0201c;seed and soil&#x0201d; hypothesis [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It states that certain cancer types prefer to grow in certain organs in a way that cannot be explained by the circulatory patterns alone. Indeed, a solid body of evidence suggests that metastatic events are regulated by many factors including tumour-intrinsic properties, specific characteristics of the host organ microenvironment, and their interaction [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Among TNBC-related cell lines, MDA-MB-231 is recognised as a highly mesenchymal invasive cell phenotype. Notably, unlike the general cohort of TNBC, MDA-MB-231 have the propensity to form osteolytic bone metastases in vivo when inoculated into the bloodstream of immunodeficient mice [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>It is recognised that one of the key processes facilitating the metastatic progression of carcinoma cells is the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). During this process, a progressive loss of intercellular junctional complexes is initiated in the polarised epithelial cells accompanied by the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype through the remodelling of the actin microfilament network, weaker intercellular adhesion and a number of other mesenchymal markers [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Hence, EMT triggers carcinoma cells dissociation from the primary tumour, invasion through the surrounding stroma, intravasation into the lymphatic or blood vessels and dissemination to distant body sites.</p><p>Despite its lethal effects, metastasis is a highly inefficient process [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Following extravasation from the bloodstream and infiltration of the parenchyma of a distant organ, disseminated tumour cells, either individually or in clusters, are exposed to an unfamiliar microenvironment characterised by a drastically different structural and molecular composition. A critical gap in our understanding of cancer metastasis, therefore, lies between the initial interaction of disseminated tumour cells with the host organ microenvironment and their successful outgrowth into micrometastases.</p><p>Carcinoma cells with an activated EMT program can revert to the epithelial phenotype through mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) allowing them to establish new colonies after reaching their destination in secondary sites. Cellular and non-cellular components of both primary tumour and host organ microenvironment play crucial roles in the initiation and progression of each step of the metastatic process including EMT [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and MET [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Among the non-cellular components, the properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM), including stiffness, structure, and composition showed a significant impact on the carcinoma cell plasticity through modulation of mechanotransduction [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A number of recent studies have recognised stiffness of the ECM as one of the critical mechanical factors contributing to the promotion of EMT in various types of cancer [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Despite numerous studies, the EMT-MET hypothesis fails to explain colonisation of secondary organs by carcinoma cells which are quasi unable to engage in MET. MDA-MB-231 cell line displaying a pronounced mesenchymal phenotype has been shown to form metastatic lesions in vivo [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We have found that the MDA-MB-231 colonisation patterns in whole-organ decellularized liver scaffolds varied dramatically across loose parenchymal (Young modulus, ~2 kPa) and denser (Young modulus, &#x0003e;2 kPa) stromal scaffold compartments [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], where cell morphology was one of the discriminants of the colonisation patterns. Cells infiltrated rapidly the parenchymal tissue, and their dominant morphological trait was identified as small round shape cells, whereas spindle-shaped, large-footprint cells were prevalent in the stromal compartment. Besides, the intriguing propensity for clustering of MDA-MB-231 cells on the stromal substrates was observed.</p><p>In this study, we have investigated the heterogeneous response of carcinoma cells to substrates fabricated with physiologically relevant stiffness levels. We deliberately chose essentially mesenchymal MDA-MB-231 cell phenotype to investigate the mechanisms enabling the formation of micrometastases by cells quite refractory to change their phenotype via MET.</p><p>It has been recently shown that cancer cell morphology is correlated with tumorigenic and metastatic potentials in vivo providing an easily measurable quantity [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Therefore, we use morphological profiling as a surrogate endpoint to measure the effect of stiffness on TNBC cell behaviour. We investigated the coupling between biochemical and morphological features using immunocytochemistry and examined the cell clustering mechanism, which may be a pivotal process in forming micrometastases.</p><p>Rapidly progressing state-of-the-art approaches of analysing and interpreting large biological datasets, including single-cell measurements derived from optical cell images, provide meaningful and oftentimes unexpected insight into both physical and molecular states of an individual cell. These approaches allow capturing cell heterogeneity in comparison with the existing population-based profiling [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In line with recent publications, in our study, we aimed to demonstrate a more data-driven approach by adopting a single-cell resolution technique [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Indeed, algorithms of machine learning are capable of compiling a large number of parameters and extract relationships between different factors to capture patterns invisible to the naked eye.</p><p>In this study, we report on the evaluation of the cellular adaptations to substrates of varying stiffness at the single-cell level. Using multi-parametric image-based cell profiling [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], followed by the application of machine learning techniques, we have identified subpopulations with distinct morphological cell types (morphs) and demonstrated the relationship between stiffness and the prevailing morphology. Further, we have analysed the expression levels of several biomarkers conventionally associated with epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes to uncover the underlying molecular alterations mediated by substrate stiffness. Taken together, our results suggest that the softer microenvironment, especially at the 2-kPa stiffness level, promotes more aggressive morphs of MDA-MB-231 cells. It was intriguing to find that the substrate, with the stiffness of 64 kPa corresponding to that of the bone tissue, promoted the expression of E-cadherin inducing pronounced cell clustering.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cell adhesion to extracellular matrix components</title><p>In our study, we used a representative human TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231 to investigate morphological and molecular changes in response to substrate stiffness.

We simultaneously tested a total of 36 conditions consisting of the 9 most common ECM proteins taken in various concentrations and combinations (see <xref rid="sec010" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>). Each condition was replicated in 9 spots imprinted on a hydrogel surface and the non-fouling material of the rest of the slide ensured specific cellular attachment. As a proxy for cell adhesion, we counted the number of cells attached to each spot 24 hours after seeding (Table B and Fig B in <xref rid="pcbi.1009193.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>). Collagens 1, 6, fibronectin and vitronectin appeared to facilitate cell adhesion while adhesion to collagens 3,4,5, laminin and tropoelastin was very minimal (Table B in <xref rid="pcbi.1009193.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>).

Dimensionality reduction techniques including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed no apparent clusters suggesting a spectrum of closely related morphs across the cell population (Fig A in <xref rid="pcbi.1009193.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Text</xref>). However, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm called hierarchical clustering (HC) enabled grouping of the data points (here, individual cells) into clusters (here, cell morphs) based on their profile similarity. As a result, we identified three subpopulations of cells displaying morphologies pertaining to distinct cell morphs. Our analysis was supported by two cluster validity indices (Silhouette score and Davies&#x02013;Bouldin index) designed to select the number of clusters in the dataset (Fig B in <xref rid="pcbi.1009193.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Text</xref>). <xref rid="pcbi.1009193.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref> demonstrated the results obtained by applying HC to single-cell profiles containing morphological and contextual measurements.

The six most important features across all stiffness levels were compactness, eccentricity, circularity, perimeter, cytoplasm circularity, and area (<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>, Fig C and D in <xref rid="pcbi.1009193.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Text</xref>). The compactness describes the concavity of a membrane, the eccentricity relates to the elongation of a cell, and the circularity measures the similarity to a perfect circle. These characteristics alongside the perimeter and area differed significantly between the three cell morphs (p &#x0003c; 0.001).

Notably, all cell morphs exhibit local extrema at 2kPa&#x02013;morphs 1 and 2 (green and red) have a local minimum, while morph 3 (blue) shows a local maximum. Small round cells (morph 3; blue) were prevailing at 2 kPa with a significant reduction in numbers on the stiffer substrates where cells were predominantly classified as morphs 1 and 2, i.e., stiffer substrates promote cell spreading and elongation with a prominent expression of lamellipodia (c.f. <xref rid="pcbi.1009193.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Note that the cell morph dependence versus the substrate stiffness falls out at 64 kPa&#x02013;the expected trend of the morph 3 cell population decline versus the substrate stiffness is reversed, while the expected growth of the morph 1 and 2 cell population is not maintained. It is worth mentioning that the cell density depicted in <xref rid="pcbi.1009193.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref> did not appear to influence cell morphology as can be seen from the distributions of the number of cell neighbours and the fraction of the shared boundary (Fig E in <xref rid="pcbi.1009193.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Text</xref>). When assessing the contribution of each feature to the cluster separability, we found that these parameters were not important, with the mutual information measuring 0.06 and 0.05, respectively.

It is worth noting that the expression of E-cadherin and vimentin at 2 kPa (and accordingly the CVR) differed significantly in comparison to the softest substrate (0.2 kPa) indicating that TNBC cells are highly sensitive to even small changes in matrix stiffness. Additionally, to investigate the variability of molecular distributions in response to substrate stiffness we performed PCA on the full sets of features describing the intensity and spatial distribution of E-cadherin, vimentin, and cytokeratins (Fig A in <xref rid="pcbi.1009193.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Text</xref>).

Additionally, we examined a fraction of the total cell fluorescent signal located along the edge of the cell. <xref rid="pcbi.1009193.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E</xref> demonstrates the comparison of cells across all stiffness levels with values for Single and Clumped cells plotted separately. A pronounced difference in the fraction of cell surface-localised E-cadherin can be noted between Single and Clumped cells. Moreover, cells cultured on 2-kPa substrates also showed an increase in junctional E-cadherin. The latter observation once again suggests possible commonalities in cell behaviour between cells cultured on 2-kPa and 64-kPa substrates.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec009"><title>Discussion</title><p>It is well established that the early steps of the metastatic cascade are facilitated by the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) allowing carcinoma cell detachment, migration, and dissemination. However, there is a lack of understanding of how cancer metastasis progresses from the initial dissemination of circulating tumour cells to a secondary organ and the ensuing formation of metastatic lesions [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Previous studies have pointed to the importance of the reverse process of EMT, namely, mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) for metastatic outgrowth, although this process remains poorly understood and unlike the inducers of EMT, few inducers of MET are known [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>The expression of E-cadherin, a trait of epithelial cells, persists in many cancer types, including primary and metastatic tumours. Furthermore, E-cadherin junctional complexes are essential for several processes occurring during metastasis&#x02013;collective cell migration and high-confluence cell proliferation [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The MB2 bone marrow tropic isogenic subline from MDA-MB-231 expresses E-cadherin in bone metastases, supporting the occurrence of MET induced by binding to E-selectin in the bone vascular niche [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], although these observations pointed towards a &#x0201c;non-canonical MET program&#x0201d; with unchanged RNA expression of the master transcriptional regulators of EMT, such as Snail1/2, Twist1/2 and Zeb1/2 suggesting a hybrid phenotype [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>In light of this new evidence, we chose the cell line MDA-MB-231 characterised by the high mesenchymal index [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. MDA-MB-231 cells are aggressive, treatment-resistant triple-negative breast carcinoma (TNBC) cells that are essentially mesenchymal since the epithelial biomarker E-cadherin expression is transcriptionally repressed by methylation of the E-cadherin promoter. We tested a set of physiologically relevant stiffness levels ranging from very soft (0.2 kPa) to highly rigid (64 kPa) and examined the heterogeneous response of the MDA-MB-231 cell population. Circulating tumour cells <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> enter bone marrow by first residing for a while in the perivascular niche (2 kPa) where they partially regain the epithelial features. They later lodge into the bone matrix (64 kPa) and become osteolytic while shifting towards an epithelial-like phenotype.</p><p>We can make several comments on our results in the context of the recent observations outlined above. Firstly, our investigation of the adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells to different components of the ECM aided by the correlation analysis suggest significant differences in the preferred and suppressed adhesion of these cells, where collagen type 1 displayed the largest adhesion. The ECM components that induce stronger adhesion can potentially contribute to cellular arrest in the tissue, while the components associated with decreased cell attachment can facilitate cell migration.</p><p>Secondly, we note that the cell density is the highest at 2 and 16 kPa, implicating the highest proliferation-to-apoptosis ratio, cell adhesion or both. It is possible that there exists a causal relationship between the cell density and cell morphology, for example, specific cell morphs may have a higher proliferation-to-apoptosis ratio. Conversely, higher cell density may result in smaller more rounded cells. Although we cannot rule out such dependency, our results add little support to this possibility.</p><p>Thirdly, by evaluating the profiles of individual cells, we showed that MDA-MB-231 cells, while displaying a continuum of morphologies, can be related to three distinct morphological types (termed cell morphs). Machine learning techniques allowed to identify the three subpopulations based on their geometric and contextual parameters and characterise each of these morphs by extracting the key distinguishing parameters. While a more granular partitioning can be produced by changing the cut-off in the dendrogram (<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>), at the high level cells group into the identified three subpopulations. Taken together, our results show that morph 1 corresponds to cells with various irregularities and lamellipodial protrusions, morph 2 consists of large flattened cells, and morph 3 is represented by small compact round cells. Notably, in their recently published study, Devaraj and Bose report on the similar morphological states of MDA-MB-468 cells [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>It is important to note that the displayed distinct morphological traits appeared highly variable across the substrate stiffness values. This implicates that cells respond to the substrate stiffness variation by remodelling their matrix adhesion and cytoskeleton. Notably, the ratios between the identified morphs change with an increase of the substrate stiffness in a nonlinear manner. Specifically, morph 3 dominated at 2 kPa but was significantly less present at the higher stiffness values. Interestingly, in a recent theoretical work, the authors showed that cells transition into one of the three cell morphs: weakly adhered (similar to morph 3), elongated with multiple protrusions (morph 1), or crescent-like (morph 2) depending on the strength of cell-substrate adhesion [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>It is worth noting that single cell clones enriched with cells displaying a cell shape with a high aspect ratio akin to morph 1 do not show a high metastatic potential [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Both morphs 1 and 2 showed an increased cell population on the stiffer substrates. The morphological traits of an individual MDA-MB-231 cell have been reported to persist for several weeks. Single cell clones with the same morphological types displayed similar in vivo behavioural patterns, including tumorigenicity, survival in circulation, and metastatic potential [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In regard to cell motility, primarily flattened cells corresponding to morph 2 are expected to exert strong interaction with the substrate and are likely to be immotile due to the presence of large stable focal adhesions [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. At the same time, protruding lamellipodia displayed by morph 1 is a hallmark of cell motility. Lastly, morph 3 may exhibit ameboid movements, however, video microscopy would be required to confirm this hypothesis.</p><p>Furthermore, we assessed the changes in expression levels of three biomarkers reporting on the cell cytoskeleton and intercellular adhesion aiming to investigate links between these changes and cell morphology. While the expression of cytokeratins was found to increase gradually with the stiffness, the intensity of vimentin displayed a nonlinear relationship peaking at the softer stiffness values. Interestingly, we also observed a local maximum in E-cadherin along with a peak in the vimentin expression at 2 kPa&#x02013;this stiffness is typical for parenchymal type tissues e.g., liver and lungs. Mechanistic interpretation suggests that compliant substrates preclude the formation of widely spread cell-matrix junctions so that the cell retracts to a small round footprint. This hampered the cell motility and caused an upregulation of vimentin to restore this property typical for mesenchymal cells.</p><p>The stiffest tested substrate (64 kPa) typical for bone tissue induced dramatic variation in TNBC cell behaviour. We observed a subpopulation of MDA-MB-231 cells that formed multicellular clusters (&#x0201c;Clumped&#x0201d;). These cells appeared to have pronounced differences in both the morphology and expression of E-cadherin compared to the single cells cultured on the same substrate (&#x0201c;Single&#x0201d;). Notably, Clumped cells mostly displayed small round morphology contrary to the large irregular footprint prevalent among Single cells. In comparison with the overall cell population, the E-cadherin expression in Single cells cultured on 64 kPa substrate was significantly greater while in Clumped cells it was relatively low. However, the localisation of E-cadherin in Clumped cells was considerably shifted towards the cell surface. Previously, a similar trend in the E-cadherin signal localisation has been observed as a result of the maturation of the cell-cell E-cadherin-mediated contacts [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Moreover, it has been shown that as the cell-cell adhesion increases, cells become smaller and are characterised by a decrease in lamellipodia formation [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] thus providing a potential explanation for the morphological differences between Single and Clumped cells.</p><p>Predominant expression of E-cadherin at the cell-cell junctions speaks in favour of a stiffness-induced mechanism of cluster formation of mesenchymal cells in bone-type tissues. It is known that expression of E-cadherin alters cell morphology and decreases fibroblast-like migration in MDA-MB-231 cells [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Moreover, local microenvironment at the secondary site may induce re-expression of E-cadherin through the changes in epigenetic regulation of the E-cadherin gene in MDA-MB-231 [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, high extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness might be one of the contributing&#x02013;if not the key&#x02013;factors forcing cell aggregation followed by re-expression of E-cadherin and changes in cell morphology, migratory and invasive behaviour [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, while organ stiffness may play a role in bone metastasis it may not be a factor in other organs such as the liver, lung and brain which are also commonly colonised by breast carcinoma cells.</p><p>These results are also in line with the observations from our previous study, where we investigated colonisation of the liver parenchymal and stromal compartments by MDA-MB-231 cells [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We showed that the cell growth and invasion patterns, as well as their morphology, critically depend on the stiffness of the ECM. In particular, it was found that among rapidly proliferating cells deep into the soft (2 kPa) parenchymal tissue, the morphological trait of a small spheroidal shape dominated (<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7F</xref>, left). Meanwhile, the dense stromal substrate stimulated the morphological type characterised by elongation and a large footprint (<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7F</xref>, right). Finally, a tendency towards the formation of multicellular and multilayer clusters of MDA-MB-231 cells was also detected exclusively in the stromal compartments.</p><p>Overall, our work helps substantiate the evidence of a significant effect of the tumour microenvironment on the cancer cell morphological and molecular adaptability. The dramatic variation of the cell behaviour of the E-cadherin-mediated cluster formation occurred on the stiffest substrate pertinent to the bone tissue implicates a potentially new promoter for clustering of mesenchymal cells critically important in metastasis [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>Further, it addresses the problem of intra-population heterogeneity and presents a framework for evaluating the morphological and molecular states of individual cells. We believe the proposed workflow can be adopted to analyse populations of cells cultured in various conditions and using a range of cell models as long as compatibility with confocal microscopy imaging and scaffold-free or gel-based 3D cultures is ensured.</p><p>It is worth mentioning, however, that the MDA-MB-231 cell line used in this study has been established a long time ago and over the years has been selected to a very stable highly mesenchymal metastatic phenotype. In the future, we aim to investigate whether differentiated breast cancer cells demonstrate a similar response to various substrate stiffness. Variable responses to EMT or MET inducers are observed using distinct cell lines and single-cell sequencing [<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1009193.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. To further investigate this phenomenon, it would be necessary to analyse single cell-derived clones to determine which clones can form clusters. Furthermore, multicellular clusters observed at the most rigid substrate may have formed through other cadherins. Further experiments are required to verify these observations with cells stained for beta-catenin together with F-actin to show its localisation at the cell cortex. Finally, verification of the machine learning model on publicly available histological samples can illuminate the translational potential of this research, specifically, in the field of digital pathology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p>No human or animal ethics approval was required for this study.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Assay substrates</title><p>To choose the best ECM protein for coating, cells were seeded on an extracellular matrix screening array, ECM Select Array Kit Ultra-36 (Advanced Biomatrix, San Diego, USA), containing 36 ECM conditions on hydrogel surface.
