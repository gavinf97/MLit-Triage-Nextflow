It was recently documented that long-term fasting improves metabolic health and enhanced the total antioxidant capacity. The present study investigated the influence of a 10-day fasting on markers of the redox status in 109 subjects. Reducing power, 2,2&#x02019;-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt radical cation(ABTS) radical scavenging capacity, and hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity increased significantly, and indicated an increase of circulating antioxidant levels. No differences were detected in superoxide scavenging capacity, protein carbonyls, and superoxide dismutase when measured at baseline and after 10 days of fasting. These findings were concomitant to a decrease in blood glucose, insulin, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglycerides as well as an increase in total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio. In addition, the well-being index as well as the subjective energy levels increased, documenting a good tolerability. There was an interplay between redox and metabolic parameters since lipid peroxidation baseline levels (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances [TBARS]) affected the ability of long-term fasting to normalize lipid levels. A machine learning model showed that a combination of antioxidant parameters measured at baseline predicted the efficiency of the fasting regimen to decrease LDL levels.&#x000a0;In conclusion, it was demonstrated that long-term fasting enhanced the endogenous production of antioxidant molecules, that act protectively against free radicals, and in parallel improved the metabolic health status. Our results suggest that the outcome of long-term fasting strategies could be depending on the baseline values of the antioxidative and metabolic status of subjects.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0015"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">Long-term fasting increases the antioxidant capacity and decreases oxidative damage.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">It improves the metabolic health status.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">High TBARS levels at baseline limit the LDL reduction during long-term fasting.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">The antioxidant status is related with the lipid lowering effect of long-term fasting.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Weight loss</kwd><kwd>Antioxidant capacity</kwd><kwd>Oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>Dysmetabolism</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0030">The combination of a sedentary lifestyle with easy access to processed foods rich in low-quality fats and sugars is largely responsible for the increase in obesity in modern Western culture, among others in Europe (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Blundell et al., 2017</xref>). Metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases as well as cancer and immune system dysfunctions have been linked to obesity (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Margin&#x00103; et al., 2020a</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">2020b</xref>). Recently during the pandemic of covid-19 obese individuals, suffering dysmetabolism, seemed to have a more severe evolution and a lower survival rate (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Nasi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Petrakis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Stefan et al., 2020</xref>). Metabolic stress can be exacerbated by the exposure to environmental pollutants and disturbing among others lipid metabolism such as pesticides (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Biserni et al., 2019</xref>), common food additives (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Ciardi et al., 2012</xref>), or even near-roadway air pollution (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="p0035">The redox status is intimately linked to metabolic status, especially lipid metabolism. This is supported by experiments showing that abnormal lipid metabolism is associated with the activation of oxidative and inflammatory pathways (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). This can be due to the modulation of transcription factors such as the nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (NRF2) which is known to coordinate the antioxidant response (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen et al., 2009</xref>), but also the metabolism of lipids including their peroxidation (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Dodson et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, there is a positive correlation between levels of oxidative stress and the atherogenicity of serum cholesterol fractions (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). This suggested that the level of oxidative stress is an early event influencing the evolution of dyslipidemia documenting the interplay between oxidative damages, redox and metabolic biomarkers.</p><p id="p0040">There is a need to find natural ways for humans to reduce the prevalence of obesity as well as dysmetabolism in order to improve their metabolic health. In addition, it would be important to improve our oxidative status and strengthen defense mechanisms against various diseases including those caused by viruses like covid-19. A possible approach to achieve these objectives could be long-term fasting, that is defined as voluntary food abstinence from 2 days to several weeks (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Wilhelmi de Toledo et al., 2020b</xref>). The study of various forms of fasting on metabolic health has been gaining ground in recent years with more and more studies showing beneficial effects such as inactivating of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways as well as several others resulting in metabolic normalization, enhanced autophagy and apoptosis followed by cell regeneration, increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in brain leading to enhanced cognition, mood as well as increased neuronal plasticity and regeneration. Fasting also enhanced the transcription of cytoprotective enzymes, mitochondrial biogenesis all of these effects leading to restoration and conservation of functional integrity of cells and tissues (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">de Cabo and Mattson, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Wilhelmi de Toledo et al., 2020b</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown that long-term fasting improved dysmetabolism as well as the antioxidant capacity (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Drinda et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Wilhelmi de Toledo et al., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">2020a</xref>).</p><p id="p0045">Modern medicine is getting personalized and machine learning algorithms are increasingly used to predict the success of therapeutic interventions based on patient individual characteristics. This was the case for the prediction of postprandial lipemic and inflammatory responses (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Berry et al., 2020</xref>), the development gestational diabetes (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Artzi et al., 2020</xref>), or even the occurrence of heart attacks and stroke (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Knott et al., 2020</xref>). Earlier studies also suggest that this can be applicable to understand redox systems as a recent study successfully developed a neural network to predict oxidative damage using measurements of antioxidants in plasma and urine (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">de la Villehuchet et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p id="p0050">Since dysmetabolism has been repeatedly correlated to an increased oxidative stress (A <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Sevanian and Hochstein, 1985</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Holvoet, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Rani et al., 2016</xref>), it can be hypothesized that beneficial effects of long-term fasting could be affected by the baseline antioxidant status of patients. The BDNF, which has its production stimulated by ketosis during fasting (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Mattson et al., 2018</xref>), is known to control the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor Nrf2 to activate antioxidant defenses (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Bouvier et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the mild oxidative stress caused by the reduction in adenosine triphosphate (ATP)/adenosine monophosphate (AMP) ratio has a similar effect to activate transcription of cytoprotective enzymes sulfiredoxin 1, thioredoxin reductase 1, heme oxygenase-1, as well as several others conjugation and elimination enzymes (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Burton et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="p0055">This article is a continuation of our previous study on the effect of a 10-day fasting on indicators of redox status of humans which showed that while the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was enhanced, TBARS, an important indicator of lipid peroxidation, were reduced (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Wilhelmi de Toledo et al., 2020a</xref>). The aim of the present article was to analyze additional redox parameters and to correlate the redox status with markers of glucose and lipid status, the improvement of which leads to a better metabolic health and a reduced risk of metabolic diseases. It was also evaluated if the baseline levels in markers of the redox status can predict the success of the fasting regimen using a machine learning approach.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="p0060">This interventional study was approved by the medical council of Baden-W&#x000fc;rttemberg, Stuttgart, on 12 February 2019 under the application number F-2018-118.

This was done by associating the levels of redox parameters with the metabolic responses. The strongest interactions were between markers of lipid peroxidation and lipid levels. Lipid peroxidation levels affected the effects of fasting on the normalization of lipid levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>
). When lipid peroxidation is high, patients are most resistant to the normalization effect of fasting (interaction p-values 8.2e-06 and 4.1e-05 for LDL and cholesterol, respectively). This remained significant if the significance cut-off threshold was corrected by the number of comparisons (&#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0002). Estimate coefficients from this model suggested that LDL levels would decrease from 4.2 to 2.3&#x000a0;mmol/L for an hypothetical patient with no lipid peroxidation, and that every increase in lipid peroxidation by 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L of TBARS would decrease the reduction in LDL levels by 0.25&#x000a0;mmol/L. The inclusion of BMI as a covariate did not change the result of this analysis, and a likelihood ratio test between a full model containing BMI as a covariate and its null model (no BMI added) was not statistically significant. It is reasonable to assume that the decreased in lipid levels caused by their use as energy substrates during fasting could be linked to the decreased lipid peroxidation.

These findings are in contrast to the preconceived idea that the antioxidant reserves would decrease during fasting due to a lack of absorbed micronutrients with known antioxidative roles (e.g. vitamin E and B, zinc, selenium) after the cessation of food intake. When exogenous antioxidants are missing, endogenous antioxidants are sufficient to maintain homeostasis. This includes uric acid and bilirubin, two important endogenous antioxidants (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Ames et al., 1981</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Sedlak et al., 2009</xref>). Although bilirubin was not measured in this study, we measured the increase in uric acid and its association with TAC, that was discussed in detail in the previous article (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Wilhelmi de Toledo et al., 2020a</xref>). It is worth mentioning again that high uric acid levels are well-known in long-term fasting and only exceptionally lead to side-effects as long as fasting individuals drink enough water (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Wilhelmi de Toledo et al., 2019</xref>). Eight-weeks intermittent fasting confirmed the increase in uric acid levels in asthmatic patients and found a reduction in oxidative stress markers like 8-prostane, nitrotyrosine, protein carbonyls and 4-hydroxynonenal adducts (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>). Bilirubin levels have been extensively studied in previous studies and, in particular, it has been observed that 48-h fasting can increase those levels by 240% while 62-h fasting by 326% (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Barrett, 1971</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Dohi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Meyer et al., 1995</xref>). It is hypothesized that organisms with protective redox systems have been selected in the course of evolution to provide protection against ROS caused aging and cancer (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Ames et al., 1981</xref>), It is plausible that resilient organisms which were able to maintain antioxidative functions during periods of famine through endogenous antioxidant production were selected in the same way.</p><p id="p0185">In the aforementioned methods for determining the antioxidant capacity of plasma, the various antioxidant molecules participate in different ways due to their physicochemical characteristics (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Benzie and Strain, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Janaszewska and Bartosz, 2002</xref>).

The strongest correlation observed was between uric acid levels and the TAC, which was expected, since much of the TAC is due to the circulating uric acid (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Janaszewska and Bartosz, 2002</xref>). However, the most important biological correlation was observed between TBARS and lipid metabolism. In general, TBARS decreased significantly after long-term fasting, as did total cholesterol, LDL and triglyceride levels, with a parallel decrease in waist circumference and BMI. Higher lipid peroxidation levels at baseline, reduced the ability of long-term fasting to normalize dyslipidemia.</p><p id="p0195">Our machine learning algorithm confirmed that the levels of TBARS is a reliable predictor of how well a person will respond to long-term fasting. This model was trained and evaluated on a modest sample size. Future studies would have to be done to test if the predictive ability of TBARS levels can be replicated in a different group of individuals, ideally larger in order to better understand the influence of demographic covariates (age, sex, diseases). Our results suggest that analyzing the antioxidative status before fasting could help to enhance the efficiency of the fasting regimen by preparing the patients with the poorest metabolic status through boosting their antioxidant status in a personalized and adapted way. In general, dietary guidelines are provided for an average population (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">European Food Safety Authority, 2017</xref>) and do not account for inter-individual differences. However, an increasing number of studies are showing that response to diet is personal and that these differences can affect disease susceptibility (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Zeevi et al., 2015</xref>). This can be due to differences in lifestyle, genetics, or even gut microbiome composition (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Berry et al., 2020</xref>). We suggest in this study that the response to fasting can also be individual and showed that it can depend on the baseline antioxidative status. Factors driving these differences would have to be evaluated in further studies including measurement of gut microbiome composition, as it was repeatedly showed to be an important factor driving personal susceptibility to disease (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Tierney et al., 2020</xref>).

We recommend that long-term fasting strategies should be personalized and adjusted to the metabolic and antioxidative baseline status of the subjects.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Funding source</title><p id="p0215">This research was funded by <funding-source id="gs1">Amplius GmbH</funding-source>, &#x000dc;berlingen, Germany, on behalf of BWC.
