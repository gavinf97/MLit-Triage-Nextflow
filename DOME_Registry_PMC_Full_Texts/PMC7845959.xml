Understanding the factors that determine the genome-wide distribution of TOP2B is therefore not only essential for a complete knowledge of genome dynamics and organization, but also for the implications of TOP2-induced DSBs in the origin of oncogenic translocations and other types of chromosomal rearrangements. Here, we conduct a machine-learning approach for the prediction of TOP2B binding using publicly available sequencing data. We achieve highly accurate predictions, with accessible chromatin and architectural factors being the most informative features. Strikingly, TOP2B is sufficiently explained by only three features: DNase I hypersensitivity, CTCF and cohesin binding, for which genome-wide data are widely available. Based on this, we develop a predictive model for TOP2B genome-wide binding that can be used across cell lines and species, and generate virtual probability tracks that accurately mirror experimental ChIP-seq data. Our results deepen our knowledge on how the accessibility and 3D organization of chromatin determine TOP2B function, and constitute a proof of principle regarding the <italic>in silico</italic> prediction of sequence-independent chromatin-binding factors.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Type II DNA topoisomerases (TOP2) are a double-edged sword. They solve topological problems in the form of supercoiling, knots and tangles that inevitably accompany genome metabolism, but they do so at the cost of transiently cleaving DNA, with the risk that this entails for genome integrity, and the serious consequences for human health, such as neurodegeneration, developmental disorders or predisposition to cancer. A comprehensive analysis of TOP2 distribution throughout the genome is therefore essential for a deep understanding of its function and regulation, and how this can affect genome dynamics and stability. Here, we use machine learning to thoroughly explore genome-wide binding of TOP2B, a vertebrate TOP2 paralog that has been linked to genome organization and cancer-associated translocations. Our analysis shows that TOP2B-DNA binding can be accurately predicted exclusively using information on DNA accessibility and binding of genome-architecture factors. We show that such information is enough to generate virtual maps of TOP2B binding along the genome, which we validate with <italic>de novo</italic> experimental data. Our results highlight the importance of TOP2B for accessibility and 3D organization of chromatin, and show that computationally predicted TOP2 maps can be accurately obtained using minimal publicly available datasets, opening the door for their use in different organisms, cell types and conditions with experimental and/or clinical relevance.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Spanish Goverment and European Regional Development Fund</institution></funding-source><award-id>SAF2017-89619-R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0440-6783</contrib-id><name><surname>Cort&#x000e9;s-Ledesma</surname><given-names>Felipe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Spanish Goverment and European Regional Development Fund</institution></funding-source><award-id>TIN2015-64776-C3-2-R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0964-9506</contrib-id><name><surname>Divina</surname><given-names>Federico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-CoG-2014-647359</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0440-6783</contrib-id><name><surname>Cort&#x000e9;s-Ledesma</surname><given-names>Felipe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>Andalusian Regional Government</institution></funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by grants from the Spanish Government and the European Regional Development Fund (SAF2017-89619-R, FCL, and TIN2015-64776-C3-2-R, FD), and the European Research Council (ERC-CoG-2014-647359, FCL).

This places them in a privileged position to integrate and coordinate many aspects of genome organization and metabolism, and have indeed been related to virtually all aspects of chromatin dynamics [<xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While the genomes of invertebrates and lower eukaryotic systems code for only one type II topoisomerase (TOP2), vertebrates encode two close paralogs (TOP2A and TOP2B) with similar catalytic and structural properties but with different roles [<xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. TOP2A is essential for cellular viability [<xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and is mainly expressed in dividing cells [<xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], where it is required for chromosome segregation [<xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. TOP2B, in contrast, is not essential at a cellular level [<xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], but is ubiquitously expressed and required for organismal viability due to roles in the transcriptional regulation of genes required for proper development of the nervous system [<xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Consistent with regulatory functions in transcription, TOP2B significantly associates with promoters and DNase I hypersensitivity sites, as well as actively regulated epigenetic modifications and enhancers [<xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, recent studies have linked TOP2B with 3D genome organization due to a strong colocalization with architectural factors such as CTCF and the cohesin complex protein RAD21 at the boundaries of topologically associated domains (TADs), which has been interpreted as TOP2B functions in resolving topological problems derived from the active organization of the genome in the context of the loop extrusion model [<xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Strikingly, TOP2B and RAD21 are spatially organized around CTCF binding sites, forming ordered triple sites that flank the boundaries of TADs in a way that TOP2B is positioned externally and cohesin internally to the domain loop.</p><p>Despite these fundamental roles in the organization and dynamics of the genome, TOP2 function can also pose a threat to its integrity [<xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Aberrant activity of TOP2, which can occur spontaneously or as a consequence of cancer chemotherapy, results in the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). These are highly cytotoxic lesions that, if inefficiently or aberrantly repaired, can seriously compromise cell survival and genome stability. Indeed, unrepaired or misrepaired DSBs can lead to genome rearrangements associated with neurodegeneration, sterility, developmental disorders and predisposition to cancer [<xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In particular, transcription-associated TOP2B function at TAD boundaries has been recently linked to oncogenic chromosomal translocations [<xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The specific functions of TOP2B in these processes are, however, still largely unexplored and far from being fully understood. A deep understanding of TOP2B function and regulation in a genome-wide context, and how it can result in chromosome fragility and alterations, will require thorough and unbiased studies, integrating different systems, cellular types and conditions.</p><p>In this work, we take advantage of the wealth of high-throughput sequencing data to comprehensively study the informative power of a wide set of chromatin features to predict TOP2B binding. We show that TOP2B localization can be accurately predicted using publicly available sequencing data, and identify architectural and open chromatin factors as the most informative features, in agreement with previously reported data [<xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, feature selection analysis indicates that TOP2B can be faithfully predicted using only three sequencing datasets. Indeed, models trained with DNase-seq and ChIP-seq of CTCF and RAD21 allow for accurate prediction across different mouse systems, supporting a generalizing association of TOP2B with these features. Finally, to validate our model we generate predictions in mouse thymocytes and human MCF7 cells and compare them with ChIP-seq data obtained in our laboratory. Genome wide predictive tracks accurately mirror experimental TOP2B tracks in both organisms, showing that our model can be used to generate virtual TOP2B signals in potentially any mammalian cell type and condition for which sequencing data of CTCF, RAD21 and DNase I hypersensitivity are available.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Processing publicly available data</title><p>The experimental data used in this study is summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007814.s017">S1 Table</xref>.

Since we were interested in highly enriched TOP2B binding sites to ensure robust learning, peaks were called for individual replicates (when available) and only overlapping peaks were kept. For each training system, we generated the same number of random regions in the genome than TOP2B binding sites were identified. Such regions were searched to have 300 bp length and were selected so that they had the same distribution across chromosomes as TOP2B peaks. Again, non-mappable regions and regions of the ENCODE blacklist were discarded. To make sure they did not overlap TOP2B binding sites not detected by MACS, regions with high levels of TOP2B/INPUT ChIP-seq signal were also discarded. In order to account for sequence composition biases, an additional set of random regions was generated so that their distribution of sequence G+C content matched that of TOP2B peaks. We proceeded using an iterative approach. Briefly, the G+C content of TOP2B peaks was first computed and an initial set of random regions was generated for each chromosome. Random regions having similar G+C content than any TOP2B peak were retained while matched TOP2B peaks were not considered in the next iteration. This process was repeated until the number of GC-random regions and TOP2B peaks were equal for each chromosome.</p><p>When we processed the experimental ChIP-seq samples generated in our lab, we found that MACS2 greatly underestimated the number of TOP2B binding sites.

In addition, we grouped peaks into five classes as described in Matthews and Waxman (2018). Briefly, open chromatin regions (DNase-seq peaks) were identified and classified based on H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and CTCF ChIP-seq signals. Promoters were defined as peaks with &#x0003e; 1.5 H3K4me3/H3K4me1 fold ratio. Enhancers were defined as peaks with &#x0003c; 0.67 H3K4me3/H3K4me1 fold ratio. The remaining DNase peaks were separated into those with a roughly equal H3K4me3/H3K4me1 fold ratio and those with low signal for both histone marks. From the the former set, those overlapping TSSs were classified as weak promoters. Low signal peaks that overlapped CTCF binding sites were classified as insulators. Finally, the remaining low signal peaks not overlapping TSSs were classified as weak enhancers.

Several marks were found to be highly enriched in both systems, such as DNase-seq, CTCF and the cohesin complex members STAG1, STAG2 and RAD21. These features also showed a high colocalization frequency with TOP2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007814.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), in line with previous findings [<xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

The final sets of TOP2B, random and GC-corrected random peaks displayed the expected genomic distribution [<xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], with TOP2B binding sites showing higher co-localization with promoters, enhancers and insulators than randomized regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007814.s003">S3(A) and S3(B) Fig</xref>). Nevertheless, forcing the G+C content of random regions to match that of TOP2B binding sites led to the former being located at GC rich sites, which in turn made them show a moderate co-localization with actively regulated regions. Since TOP2B is expected to localize at such regions, we generated heatmaps to examine the ChIP-seq signal at TOP2B, random, and GC-corrected random peaks and observed enrichment only at the center of TOP2B peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007814.s003">S3(C) Fig</xref>), indicating that our background regions are adequate for subsequent training.</p><p>We employed Support Vector Machine (SVM) [<xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and Naive Bayes (NB) [<xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] to build up the predictive models and used 5-fold cross-validation to estimate the prediction accuracy. We started by training on the whole set of features. Accurate predictions were obtained for the two murine systems using both the GC-corrected and the regular model (Tables <xref rid="pcbi.1007814.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1007814.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007814.g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007814.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), indicating that chromatin features can faithfully explain TOP2B binding. As a matter of fact, SVM trained on all features performed considerably better than NB. For instance, while regular models trained with NB achieved accuracies of 71% and 77.4% for MEF and liver, respectively, these values increased to 98% and 97.4% when using SVM. Similarly, accuracies obtained training the GC-corrected models with NB were 74.1% and 76.2% for MEF and liver, respectively, whereas SVM produced accuracies of 96.7% and 93%. Such performance differences are likely to be explained by many features showing dependencies to each other or being poorly informative. This would impair NB performance, which assumes all features are independent. Indeed, removal of not informative features leads to a significant increase of accuracies achieved by the NB algorithm (see next sections).</p><fig id="pcbi.1007814.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007814.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Chromatin features predict TOP2B binding.</title><p>ROC curves and AUC values for Support Vector Machine models trained on the indicated sets of features (for Naive Bayes models, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007814.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1007814.g003"/></fig><table-wrap id="pcbi.1007814.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007814.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Performance of SVM and NB classifiers in MEF.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi.1007814.t001g" xlink:href="pcbi.1007814.t001"/><table frame="box" rules="all" border="0"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">System</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Category</th><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">GC corrected</th><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Random</th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NB</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SVM</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NB</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SVM</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="9" colspan="1">MEF</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">All</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">74.18 &#x000b1;

In addition to the accuracy and the AUC values, here we also considered the average number of features selected by each strategy and the stability of each algorithm.

This issue is especially important in high dimensional domains where strategies may yield to different solutions with similar performance and, therefore, this measure enhances the confidence in the analysis of the results.</p><p>Both feature selection algorithms succeeded in finding a subset of features that faithfully explained TOP2B binding in both systems, with accuracies ranging from 92.1% to 96.11% (<xref rid="pcbi.1007814.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). As a matter of fact, although in mouse liver the two classification approaches (SVM and NB) achieved the same performance for both feature selection algorithms, this was not the case in MEFs, in which the SVM slightly outperformed NB predictions. Regarding the number of selected features, while FCBF needed averages of 46 and 22 features to optimize the prediction of TOP2B in MEF and liver, respectively, SS only needed 3 features in both systems (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007814.s018">S2 Table</xref>).

Furthermore, the results obtained by the SS algorithm strengthen the importance of accessible chromatin and architectural factors for TOP2B binding, and shows that a small number of these features are enough to achieve accurate genome-wide predictions. Indeed, comparison of models trained using the whole set of chromatin features with models trained only with SS-selected features showed that both sets achieved similar performances (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007814.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Therefore, we decided to use only the three SS-selected features for subsequent analyses. It is noteworthy to mention that, since data on STAG2 binding is rather scarce, we focused on DNase-seq, RAD21 and CTCF. Although the latter was only selected in MEFs, it was among the most informative features in mouse liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007814.g004">Fig 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007814.s018">S2 Table</xref>), and there is a wealth of ChIP-seq data available for this protein.

We used this model to generate genome wide predictions of TOP2B binding in several systems, including those used for training and two additional systems that served as the validation sets (see next sections). To do so, we split the genome in 300 bp windows, scored DNase-seq, CTCF and RAD21 signals and applied the TOP2B generalizing classifier within such windows, obtaining probability values through the whole genome for each system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007814.s009">S9 Fig</xref>).</p><p>The fact that only three features are sufficient to predict TOP2B binding genome wide opens the question of whether our model is truly informative, or similar performances could be achieved by simply considering the merged set of DNAse-seq, CTCF and RAD21 peaks.

Regarding the 117, 714 DNase-CTCF-RAD21 detected peaks, this percentage decreased to 37%, suggesting that the merged-peak approach could lead to the selection of a large number of false positives. Indeed, while the specific potential false positives of our model (not identified by ChIP or by the merged set) clearly displayed TOP2B signal in heatmaps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007814.s010">S10(B) Fig</xref>, bottom), this was greatly reduced in the case of the specific DNase-CTCF-RAD21 set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007814.s010">S10(B) Fig</xref>, top).

We identified 79, 596 regions with a probability of TOP2B binding above 0.95, including 45.98% of experimental peaks from replicate 1, 56.75% of experimental peaks from replicate 2 and 74.45% of common peaks, showing that our predictions behave as a virtual experimental replicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007814.g006">Fig 6G</xref>). Since our predictions revealed an additional set of 55, 311 peaks that were not detected by HOMER, we assessed whether these corresponded to potential false positives, as described above: predicted and confirmed by HOMER in both replicates (R1-R2-P), predicted and confirmed only by the first (R1-P) or the second replicate (R2-P), only predicted (P-only), only detected by the first replicate (R1-only) and only detected by the second replicate (R2-only). We observed a similar pattern as in our previous analysis in mouse thymocytes, with predicted peaks confirmed by both antibodies showing the highest enrichment of TOP2B reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007814.g006">Fig 6H</xref>). Again, we examined peaks only predicted by our model in a genome browser and confirmed that they corresponded to true binding sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007814.s015">S15 Fig</xref>). On the other hand, R1-only and R2-only peaks were found to be enriched in our probability track, which indicates that they were not detected as predicted peaks because of the defined threshold of 0.95 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007814.s015">S15 Fig</xref>). These results confirm that the model is also accurate in predicting TOP2B binding in human cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Prediction of TOP2-induced DSBs</title><p>Upon etoposide treatment, abortive TOP2 activity results in DSBs at CTCF-RAD21 sites, as measured by the END-seq method [<xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Since TOP2-induced DSBs have important implications for cancer-linked translocations [<xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007814.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], we decided to test the capacity of our model to predict these breaks. Given that many of the datasets provided by Canela <italic>et al</italic> (2017) correspond to MEFs, we focused our analysis on this cell line and processed an END-seq sample treated with etoposide in addition to the already analyzed TOP2B ChIP-seq dataset (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007814.s017">S1 Table</xref>). A genome browser view of a chromatin loop near the <italic>Lrp8</italic> gene revealed an enrichment of END-seq and TOP2B ChIP-seq signals at the anchors, which was accurately mirrored by our predictive track (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007814.s016">S16(A) Fig</xref>). We performed peak calling on the END-seq sample and identified 4, 363 DSBs. Then, we applied our model and computed AUC values, obtaining accurate predictions of END-seq peaks (AUC of 0.91), although still lower than those achieved on the ChIP-seq sample (AUC of 0.99) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007814.s016">S16(B) Fig</xref>). We next performed peak overlap analysis to further compare our genome wide predictions with the experimental DSBs. We used our previously generated TOP2B virtual track and filtered regions with a probability greater than 0.95. This resulted in 87, 205 predicted peaks, including 61.2% of experimental DSBs and 83.3% of ChIP-seq peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007814.s016">S16(C) Fig</xref>). Thus, our model achieves a reasonably high prediction accuracy when applied to TOP2-induced DSBs, but, as expected, is clearly better in predicting TOP2B binding. We argue that other factors beyond binding itself may be implicated in TOP2B activity and subsequent DSB formation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec028"><title>Conclusion</title><p>TOP2B is a crucial enzyme for DNA metabolism whose activity is required for a wide range of cellular processes including replication, transcription and genome organization. The few genome-wide maps of TOP2B that are currently available show high colocalization with several chromatin features, but no work has been devoted to comprehensively study predictive features that define TOP2B binding. By applying feature selection techniques, we show that TOP2B binding can be accurately predicted using only three high-throughput sequencing datasets, DNase-seq and ChIP-seq of RAD21 and CTCF, highlighting the importance of TOP2B in the regulation of genome architecture. Since the above datasets are largely available in public databases, our framework allows the scientific community to predict TOP2B binding in a large set of organisms, cell types, tissues and biological conditions. Finally, we believe that this approach and the generation of virtual probability tracks could be applied to other chromatin binding factors with a similar sequence-independent binding behavior to TOP2B.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec029"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1007814.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Genome browser view for TOP2B ChIP-seq signal and other relevant chromatin features in MEFs.</title><p>From top to bottom, TOP2B (grey), Pol2 (purple), RNA-seq (black), DNase-seq (yellow), architectural factors (blue) and a selection of histone marks (green) are displayed.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1007814.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1007814.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Enrichment of CpG methylation around TOP2B binding sites in mouse liver and MEFs.</title><p>Average of whole genome bisulfite sequencing reads within &#x000b1;1 kb of TOP2B binding center, random regions and GC corrected random regions are displayed.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1007814.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1007814.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Genomic distribution and signal enrichment of TOP2B training peaks.</title><p><bold>A.</bold> In the left panel, peaks were grouped into five classes as described in Matthews and Waxman, 2018 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Materials and methods</xref>): promoters, weak promoters, enhancers, weak enhancers and insulators.

</p><p>Dear Dr. Cort&#x000e9;s-Ledesma,</p><p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "Genome-wide prediction of topoisomerase II&#x003b2; binding by architectural factors and chromatin accessibility" for consideration at PLOS Computational Biology.</p><p>As with all papers reviewed by the journal, your manuscript was reviewed by members of the editorial board and by several independent reviewers. In light of the reviews (below this email), we would like to invite the resubmission of a significantly-revised version that takes into account the reviewers' comments. Even though we expect you to address each comment, it seems to us to be essential that you particularly address concerns&#x000a0; about the&#x000a0;distinction of the contribution of this work from ref 11 and other related literature, comparison to a simple baseline prediction&#x000a0;(regions with CTCF, DNaseI and cohesin peaks), antibody validation, availability of the code (GitHub or similar) and data (please&#x000a0;include the token within the main manuscript in addition to the cover letter), and clarification about feature selection strategy.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;</p><p>We cannot make any decision about publication until we have seen the revised manuscript and your response to the reviewers' comments. Your revised manuscript is also likely to be sent to reviewers for further evaluation.</p><p>When you are ready to resubmit, please upload the following:</p><p>[1] A letter containing a detailed list of your responses to the review comments and a description of the changes you have made in the manuscript.&#x000a0;Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available.

They use a range of computing methods to compare the genomic locations of TOP2B peaks/enriched regions with the peaks for the other types of proteins (CTCF, RAD21 etc). They also look at chromatin accessibility (DNAase hypersentivity) and various DNA features including CpG islands.</p><p>They do find concordance between TOP2B peaks DNAase hypersenitive regions and CTCF and RAD21.

Approximately half of all CTCF/cohesion-bound regions coincided with TOP2B binding.

The model can be used to predict both mouse and human TOPO2 beta localization. These results are based on the previously observed strong co-localization of TOPO2 beta with CTCF, cohesion and DNaseI accessible sites from several research groups in both mouse and human cells. The models show very good accuracy, with reported ~95% of TOPO2 beta peaks called using the trained sets with the models, and ~90% accuracy using the experimental data sets (MCF7, mouse thymocytes). Overall this is a well-done manuscript. However, given the strong co-localization of TOPO2 beta with the features used to develop the models (DNaseI, CTCF and cohesion), its utility is somewhat diminished. I recommended publication of this manuscript provided the following concerns are addressed.</p><p>Major Points</p><p>1.) It has been well known that TOPO2 beta co-localizes with DNaseI, CTCF and cohesion binding sites. It seems that much of the TOPO2 binding can be predicted summing the unique peak calls from the three chromatin elements (Fig 1C). What is the overlap frequency of TOPO2 beta peaks to the combined CTCF, DNaseI and Rad21 peaks (removing redundant peak calls &#x02013; Bedtools Merge function)? Can this simple method achieve worse/similar/better accuracy that the computational methods? Can this analysis be added to Figure 5 (or as a supplement). A similar presentation can be used as in Figure 5 with the merged DNAseI, CTCF and Rad21 peak data set replacing the &#x0201c;Predicted&#x0201d; data set from the authors models. This could serve as good control as to the superiority of the authors models.</p><p>2.) It has been known for some time that regions of open chromatin are &#x0201c;sticky&#x0201d;. This has been seen when using IgG controls in ChIP-Seq experiments and when ChIPing proteins which do not associate with chromatin like GFP. This is a aprticulare problem if the washing is not stringent enough. I would like the authors to process an IgG control ChIP-Seq data set for one other their cell lines (at similar read density to the TOPO2 Beta data set), call peaks using similar parameters as used to call TOPO2 Beta peaks and determine the overlap with their TOPO2 Beta peaks and predicted peaks as seen in Figure 5 B, E. Can the analysis be included in the supplement?</p><p>3.) It is important to validate antibodies prior to using them for ChIP-Seq experiments. I don&#x02019;t see that the authors have validated the TOPO2 Beta antibodies used for the ChjIP-Seq experiments. Can a extract of total cellular proteins be resolved on a 4-20% gradient gel and the antibodies used for ChIP-Seq be used to do a Western blot? Is one band observed at the expected molecular weight? Can this be added to the supplement?</p><p>4.) I don&#x02019;t see anywhere in the manuscript that the code to run the model is available. I do see a GEO deposit number. Does this have the code to run the model? I am assuming it is not available to the reviewers as a reviewer link and password is not provided. The code needs to be made freely available. Detailed instructions should be provided on how to run the code, using CTCF, RAD21 and DNAseI inputs, to get the predicted TOPO2 Beta output.</p><p>Minor Points</p><p>1.) Can a key be added to 1B and 1D? as in figure 1C? It is difficult for the reader to go to the figure legend to determine what the groups are.</p><p>2.) Can the ChIP-Seq peak calls and the &#x0201c;predicted&#x0201d; peak cells be added for each track in Figure 6 A and B? Also, supplemental Fig S6, S7 and Fig 1A?</p><p>Reviewer #3: Summary:</p><p>Martinez-Garcia et al., built several machine learning models to predict the genome-wide binding of topoisomerase II beta (TOP2B) using sequence features, DNA shape, and chromatin properties obtained from publically available data. The authors showed that open chromatin and occupancy of chromatin architecture proteins are consistently the best predictors.Using only DNase I signal, CTCF, and RAD21 binding, the authors were able to accurately predict TOP2B binding. With experimental validations, the authors showed that the predictive power of these three features is conserved across cell types and between human and mouse, achieving performance similar to biological replicates. Furthermore the predicted probability of TOP2B binding highly resembles experimental data showing the potential of using such a model to achieve quantitative predictions.</p><p>We find the work by Martinez-Garcia et al. to be interesting and the manuscript well-written and should be of general interest to genome biologists and those with specific interests in DNA topoisomerases and DNA repair. This is a computational biology paper takes published observations that TOP2B correlates well with cohesin and DNA and formalizes them into a predictive model. Understanding TOP2B binding has important implications yet experiments are often limited by the availability of antibodies. Thus, the predictive model proposed in the manuscript is a valuable approach that could be applied by others. The authors evaluated different models and feature selection methods. Reasonable approaches appear to be taken both computationally and experimentally. For example, the authors carefully tested and interpreted the usage of GC-corrected background sets and used two different TOP2B antibodies for experimental validation.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>The major concerns I have come from:</p><p>1) Apparent lack of availability of data (no reviewer token was given and so I could not check the if appropriate data and metadata was submitted. Small but crucial details such as the specific antibodies (e.g. no part number was provided) used were not included in the methods and there was no way to assess whether this, along with other crucial metadata was included in the GEO submission referred to.</p><p>2) Equally important would be to address the lack of code and intermediate files that would allow others, including reviewers, to replicate the findings. Given this paper uses existing and appropriate models to make useful predictions, it would be most important that other computational biologist can easily replicate them and make new predictions.</p><p>3) There seems to be no direct acknowledgement and exploration (aside from a citation) of recent papers that generated original data, and made computational models, to reveal and predict the location of TOP2 covalent complexes. Specifically the original END-seq method has been demonstrated to capture TOP2 covalent complexes (Canela et al. 2017 PMID: 28735753 and PMID: 31202577). In Canela et al. 2017 PMID: 28735753 they presented a linear regression model that could predict DNA breaks (TOP2cc&#x02019;s) using only RAD21. It would be important for the authors to more directly relate their work to this study. Given this current study and the previous study used MEFs there would be specific opportunities to see how well the author&#x02019;s current model predicts the END-seq (TOP2cc) data from Canela et al. 2017. At the very least some discussion is warranted giving both studies highlight the importance of cohesin in their predictions.</p><p>Detailed comments:</p><p>1) Method: For processing: &#x0201c;raw reads were merged for biological replicates&#x0201d;. For identification of binding sites: &#x0201c;when replicates were possible, peaks were called for individual replicates and overlapping peaks were kept&#x0201d;. It is thus not clear if biological replicates were merged prior to alignment or not.</p><p>2) Method: it is not exactly clear how the additional set of GC-matched controls was generated.</p><p>3) Method: the features used clearly violates the assumptions of NB. The authors did not clarify why they were still interested to try out the method.</p><p>4) Are the random controls showing similar genomic distribution (distance to TSS for example) as TOP2B peaks?</p><p>5) Line 233-234, 15 experiments used for model training is not clearly indicated in table S1. It is thus not clear which datasets were used for the classification shown in Table 1. This is then explained in lines 272-277. However, it will be more clear if it&#x02019;s explained before getting into prediction results.</p><p>6) Interpretation: line 297, &#x0201c;These observations contrast with previous findings of TOP2B being involved in transcriptional regulation [47], and may indicate that other chromatin features, such as histone marks and DNase-seq, are capturing such association..&#x0201d; Would the authors expect difference performance if they used RNAP2 instead of RNA-seq? Could predictions for TOP2B at specific genomic regions (TSS/first exon) be a more appropriate question when RNA-seq is used? More details in the discussion how these results contrast previous results would be welcomed. For instance, the association of TOP2B occupancy with cohesin and DNAse I has been revealed in several studies as has its association with transcribed genes. Canela et al.&#x02019;s END-seq work PMID: 28735753 clearly showed that without transcription a linear model with RAD21 binding could predict TOP2cc genome wide. To me it seems the results here from Martinez-Garcia et al are congruent with previous work. Discussing this would be relevant. Furthermore, the fact that transcription was relevant for TOP2 mediated DSBs is worth mentioning (using modified END-seq from Canela et al. PMID: 31202577 along with Gothe et al (PMID: 31202576)).</p><p>7) Analysis: Fig1D, GG signal peak seems to be biased on one side? Is this driven by a few regions?</p><p>8) Analysis: Fig6, it would be good to add a genome-wide correlation measure between prediction probability and real ChIP-seq data.</p><p>9) Analysis: The proposed model is trained using TOP2B peaks but the prediction is made on sliding windows across the genome. Could the authors train the model using whole-genome sliding windows or comment on the potential/necessity of doing so. Is it possible to adopt other models to be able to predict the quantitative signal (instead of classification)?</p><p>Reviewer #4: In the manuscript, the authors proposed a computational approach to predict TOP2B binding sites using chromatin accessibility and architectural proteins. The authors compared the performance of three classifiers: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine and Random Forests on a bunch of different features including: histone marks, Pol2 binding, architectural components, chromatin accessibility, gene expression, DNA shape, DNA sequence and CpG methylation. Next, they conducted feature selection and found that DNase I hypersensitivity, CTCF and cohesin binding are the most important features to predict TOP2B binding sites. Then, they trained a generalized model using these three features in one cell type and applied the model to a different cell type and validated the predictions with ChIP-seq of TOP2B, showing that the generalized model can predict TOP2B binding sites in new cell line and species.</p><p>TOP2B plays important roles in DNA metabolism and 3D organization of chromatin. But currently there are few TOP2B ChIP-seq datasets available. Based on the high accuracy of the predictions presented in the manuscript, this approach offers an attractive way to predict TOP2B binding in different cell types and tissues using the public available datasets. The manuscript is well written and is sound and accurate in general.</p><p>Comments</p><p>1. Why is Random Forests added after feature selection, not at the beginning of the comparing different features and feature selection? RF can also identify the most important features. Would the important features selected by RF be consistent with the ones selected by FCBF and SS?</p><p>2. In the &#x0201c;Feature selection algorithms&#x0201d; method section, the authors mention that FCBF uses SU as goodness function in line 124, and then mention CFS measure is used as goodness function in line 138. Is CFS used instead of SU in FCBF? Could the authors provide more details?</p><p>3. Could the authors add the comparison of models trained using all features vs three important features to validate that the prediction accuracy is not reduced much.</p><p>4. For feature selection, SS selects DNase-seq, RAD21 and STAG2 as important features in liver, while DNase-seq, RAD21 and CTCF in MEF. Could the authors compare the performance of the model trained using DNase-seq, RAD21 and CTCF with the model trained using DNase-seq, RAD21 and STAG2 in liver to support that the performance is similar?</p><p>5. The authors compared the predicted peaks with HOMER detected peaks. Did the authors compare this predictive model with other models that can predict TF binding sites (e.g. DRAF)?</p><p>6. Did the authors apply this approach to predict other TF binding sites, e.g. TOP2A? How is the performance of that?</p><p>7. The authors should provide more description about the machine learning framework. It is not clear what package if any was used. Code and scripts should be provided along with the training data. It would be nice to provide the folds of validation too.</p><p>**********</p><p><bold>Have all data underlying the figures and results presented in the manuscript been provided?</bold></p><p>Large-scale datasets should be made available via a public repository as described in the <italic>PLOS Computational Biology</italic>

I think the authors did a good job of giving the reviewer what they wanted, but the result is very confusing. In supp Fig 10 the authors show that 100% of the R2 peaks overlap with the merged peaks, and ~70% with the predicted peaks. If that is the case why would not 70% of the rows in the Merged-only heat map analysis have the high enrichment scores as seen in the Predicted-only heat map analysis? Similarly for the R1? This heat map analysis does not make sense. The Merged-only heat map shows all very low enrichments, but 70% should be as high as those shown in the Predicted-only heat map.</p><p>Major point 2 - The requested analysis was not done. Maybe I was not completely clear. I wanted the authors to down load a IGG pulldown ChIP-Seq data set and use it in their peak calling algorithm and determine the overlap with their Top2 ChIP-Seq data sets and the predicted data sets. As is shown now it is very difficult to know what the authors did. I don't see any discussion of IGG controls in any of the text, methods. What was actually done?</p><p>Major point 3 - The validation is wholly inadequate. I requested a 4-20 gradient gel. What is shown is only a band which is about the correct MW for the target (Top2). I would like to see if the antibodies used in the study cross react with other cellular proteins.</p><p>Major point 4 - this has been addressed adequately.</p><p>Minor point 1 - this has been addressed adequately.</p><p>Minor point 2 - 6A- Novus is missing the peak calls, Fig 1A is missing all peak calls, S11, S12, S13, S15, S16 are missing peak calls. It would be best for the reader to see these peaks calls, to understand what is being called in each track and see visually the agreement/disagreement between the tracks.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;I think the authors addressed my concerns as well as those of the other reviewers.</p><p>Reviewer #4:&#x000a0;The authors have adequately addressed my comments and concerns. Their model has now been more rigorously tested and the manuscript is greatly improved.</p><p>There are some minor comments that need to be addressed:</p><p>1) Mislabeled Fig S4 as Fig S3 in multiple places: legend of Figure 3, line 363, line 375</p><p>2) Table 4 and S8 Fig: The cross-validation performance in Liver based on SVM (76.15 &#x000b1; 9.76%) is lower than the cross-system performance (Liver/MEF 93.11% and Liver/aB cells 98.21%). Is the accuracy of the cross-validation performance in Liver based on SVM correct?
