Genome-wide screening then utilizes cells stably expressing dCas9-KRAB (CRISPRi), photoactivatable fluorescent protein (PA-mCherry), and a lentiviral guide RNA (gRNA) pool. Cells are screened by using microscopy and classified by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, which precisely identify the genetically altered phenotype.

A proof-of-concept screen accurately identified PINK1 as essential for Parkin recruitment to mitochondria. A genome-wide screen identified factors mediating TFEB relocation from the nucleus to the cytosol upon prolonged starvation. Twenty-one of the 64 hits called by the neural network model were independently validated, revealing new effectors of TFEB subcellular localization.

RNAi, CRISPRi, and CRISPR screens rely on two main strategies: arrayed and pooled screens. Arrayed screens are highly specific, but require the production and, by definition, individual assortment of each RNAi or CRISPR guide separately, requiring high-throughput equipment not readily available to academic laboratories. Pooled screens are more facile, but had been restricted to phenotypes that affect cell growth rates or viability or result in a fluorescence increase that allows for isolation of hits from the population by using FACS. Single-cell RNA-based pooled screens are also useful to link genetic profiles to perturbations (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Horlbeck et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Datlinger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Dixit et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adamson et al., 2016</xref>). The use of image-based pooled genetic screens linking phenotypes to genotypes was previously reported in three independent studies in which in situ barcoded sequencing was coupled to phenotypes. First, this approach was used to identify photostable and brighter variants of a fluorescent protein by testing 60,000 mutation variants (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Emanuel et al., 2017</xref>). Then, an in situ platform was integrated with CRISPR genetic screens to identify genes involved in RNA nuclear localization, while another CRISPR screen used in situ sequencing imaging to identify factors associated with nuclear factor &#x003ba;B translocation regulation. These later two methods screened 162 CRISPR guides in <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2019</xref>) and 3,063 guides in <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Feldman et al. (2019</xref>). More recently, a semiarrayed 12,500 gRNA CRISPR screen was used to identify regulators of stress granule formation (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Wheeler et al., 2020</xref>). These methods enable the investigation of protein pathways regulating subcellular organization and positioning in an unbiased manner. In addition to unbiased CRISPR screens linking microscopic phenotypes to genotypes, single-cell images linking microscopic phenotypes to genotypes were established by a new method called single-cell magneto-optical capture (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Binan et al., 2019</xref>). Although these processes are elegant and will improve genetic studies, they are not well suited for high-throughput large-scale screens. Hence, we propose that a simple photoactivation of cells with desired phenotypes coupled to cell sorting will reduce image-based screen complexity. Previously, B lymphocyte isolation and characterization were conducted from photoactivatable transgenic mice by coupling photoactivation and flow cytometry (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Victora et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, in a more recent study, photoactivation coupled to flow cytometry enabled the investigation of the link between the morphology response to a drug and the genetic profile at single-cell resolution (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hasle et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Recent advances in machine learning, and particularly in deep learning (convolutional neural networks [CNN]; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Caicedo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bzdok et al., 2018</xref>), offer novel strategies for identifying individual cells with altered organelle morphology or subcellular protein localization. We developed a screening method to identify genetic perturbations of subcellular morphologies that is widely applicable and high throughput. The method is divided into four steps. First, a morphology classification model is trained on single-cell images. Second, pools of CRISPRi-perturbed target cells are imaged sequentially, and the phenotypically selected cells are labeled by laser photoactivation of a fluorescent protein. Third, the photoactivated cells are sorted. Fourth, the guides within the phenotypically identified cells are amplified and sequenced. The decision to select cells is made on the fly by pretrained classification models allowing for screening of 10<sup>6</sup> cells within 12 h and the whole human genome in a week.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3"><title>Building the single-cell imaging screening approach</title><p>We developed a new platform that assesses images of cells and uses machine learning to distinguish their subcellular phenotypes. By using laser activation of a fluorescent probe to denote the selected cell phenotypes and FACS to separate the cells for guide sequencing, one essentially converts the individual cells exposed to pooled CRISPRi libraries into an arrayed screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref>, i&#x02013;iii). By using this approach, every imaged cell is referred to as an independent entity, and a predicted phenotype score is produced based on a classification machine-learning model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref>, ii). Making the artificial intelligence (AI) platform entails three steps: training and creation of the phenotype classification model, model deployment on pooled imaged cells, and validation of the model&#x02019;s screening performance. We used Pink1-dependent Parkin translocation to mitochondria as a proof of concept (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref>). In cells with unimpaired polarized mitochondria, Parkin is in the cytoplasm; however, upon mitochondrial depolarization, it translocates to mitochondria (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Narendra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, b and c</xref>). This binary switch in the Parkin location is suitable for detection by a support vector machine (SVM) classification model. An SVM classification model was trained on images of cells with either cytosolic or mitochondrial GFP-Parkin. To build the SVM classification model, 18 features were computed from 2,500 single-cell images of cytosolic or mitochondrial GFP-Parkin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 d</xref>). The features were computed by using the R image processing and analysis package, EBImage (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Pau et al., 2010</xref>). To prevent classifier overfitting and reduce the computational cost, five cellular features measuring the 5% intensity quantile, the SD of intensity, minimum radius, eccentricity, and area that showed distinct variation were selected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 e</xref>). The selected features and labeled cell images were computationally applied on a nonlinear SVM algorithm for creating the classification model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1 a</xref>).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Machine learning genetic screening platform for Parkin localization: proof of principle screen.

To prevent overfitting, we shuffled the featured data and split it into two unique groups, a test set and a training image set. We then fitted an SVM model on the training set and evaluated it on the test set, and then an accuracy score was calculated. This procedure was iterated 100 times where every observation was allowed to be used in the training or test set only once. On &#x0223c;5,000 single-cell images, the classifier accuracy was 99% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1, b and c</xref>). Next, we generated an easy-to-use graphical user interface program to facilitate image segmentation, measurement, and model building (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2</xref>). The R-based script for image segmentation and analysis, as well as the SVM classification model, were deployed on the fly to identify cells exhibiting the desired phenotype&#x02014;GFP-Parkin mitochondrial localization. During live-cell image acquisition, single-cell images were captured following segmentation and stored on a local computer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Fig. S2</xref>). The accuracy of the segmentation procedure was compared with the gold standard manual segmentation by using the Nikon Imaging System (NIS) elements imaging software. The segmentation was evaluated by calculating the intersection over union. Comparing the intersection over union of the current segmentation procedure with CellProfiler showed very similar segmentation scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1 c</xref>). The SVM-based model classified the individual cells and generated a mask corresponding to the live image field identifying the location of cells with the phenotype of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). In cells identified with this mask, photoactivatable mCherry (pa-mCh) was then laser photoactivated. Selected cells were photoswitched by illumination of 50 ms/pixel dwell time with 80% UV laser intensity. This parameter was chosen so as to reduce the photoactivation time, eliminate unwanted activation of adjacent cells, and maximize signal intensity. This 10-s process was iterated across serial images of the entire chamber slide&#x02014;an average of 600,000 cells for one subgenomic CRISPRi guide pool (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Horlbeck et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, the photoactivated samples were sorted by using flow cytometry and were deep sequenced to determine sgRNA abundance in the activated sample compared with untreated cells.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="figS2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure S2.</label><caption><p><bold>Shiny AI-PS Application and output files.</bold> Detailed instructions and the source package for the AI-PS graphical user interface (GUI) can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/hbaldwin07/GK_shiny_app">https://github.com/hbaldwin07/GK_shiny_app</ext-link>.

First, dCas9-KRAB (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Horlbeck et al., 2016</xref>) was expressed and tested in U2OS cells expressing pa-mCh and GFP-Parkin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Fig. S1 d</xref>). To calculate the sorting accuracy of the detected and photoactivated cells from the entire population, we experimentally mixed cells blocked for Parkin recruitment with WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 a</xref>). In brief, we gradated a mixture of blue fluorescent protein (BFP)&#x02013;tagged gRNA-targeting PINK1 cells with WT cells expressing GFP-Parkin and dCas9-KRAB and pa-mCh in a ratio of either 0.1%, 0.5%, 5%, or 10% sgPINK1 with WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 a</xref>, i). Then, cells were treated with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) to stimulate Parkin activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 a</xref>, ii). Cells with Parkin evenly spread in the cytosol that had failed to activate the PINK1-Parkin pathway were photoactivated and sorted. The sensitivity and specificity of cells were analyzed from the BFP and pa-mCh intensity ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 a</xref>, iii and iv). First, we observed that, with a phenotype penetration from 0.5% to 10%, both the precision and recall scored similarly at &#x0223c;85% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, b&#x02013;d</xref>); however, reducing the phenotype penetration to 0.1% resulted in a reduction in both recall and precision for values to 65% and 50%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, b&#x02013;d</xref>). Therefore, in comparison to the previous study (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hasle et al., 2020</xref>), the FACS separation performance values are slightly lower in precision (85% vs. 94%) and slightly higher in recall values (86% vs. 80%). Similar to previous work with the pa-mCh fluorescent protein that we used in the current study (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Patterson and Lippincott-Schwartz, 2002</xref>), we found that UV light activation resulted in an 80-fold increase in signal intensity.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="fig2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Performance evaluation of AI-PS flow cytometry sorting.

We performed this analysis and compared our CNN classification model to average pixel intensity in the nucleus vs. the cytoplasm-based prediction. Comparing CNN performance to pixel intensity computing yielded no significant difference in performance (CNN model prediction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, c and d</xref>; and parametric model prediction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3, d and e</xref>). These results indicate that, in the case of the TFEB translocation classification problem, both methods preform equally and sufficiently for this task. The accuracy of pixel intensity computation of the parametric model is slightly greater than the CNN model (90% vs. 88%), whereas the classification prediction of the CNN model is better in specificity (97% vs. 83%). In the nature of the current screen, as the frequency of the desired cell phenotype is low, specificity is more of interest relative to sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, c and d</xref>; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3, d and e</xref>).

In addition, the loss of another hit, Pitx2, in vivo causes an increase in mitophagy that has been linked to TFEB activation (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Nezich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2019</xref>).

As phosphorylation of TFEB is intimately linked to its activation and subcellular localization (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Puertollano et al., 2018</xref>), this hit deserves further mechanistic study. The extensively studied TFEB regulator, mTOR, was not significantly enriched in our photoactivated samples. To explore this explicitly, live-cell imaging of starved GFP-TFEB infected with two distinct sgRNAs targeting mTOR showed an accumulation of TFEB on lysosomes, which resulted in punctate cytosolic foci, which was similar to previous reports (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Martina and Puertollano, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Settembre et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>). Therefore, mTOR was not identified in the enrichment analysis owing to the lack of classification of this specific mTOR phenotype, which is distinct from the deep learning model trained for nuclear localization.

CREB5 belongs to the transcription factor family, CAMP Responsive Element Binding Protein (CREB). CREB1 was previously reported to mediate autophagy and induce the expression of several autophagy genes, including Ulk1, Atg5, and Atg7, upstream of TFEB following starvation and TFEB itself (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Seok et al., 2014</xref>). Certain autophagy genes are more predominantly activated by CREB1 and others more by TFEB. Interestingly, CREB5 knockdown in U2OS cells caused a decrease in protein expression of the autophagy protein, LC3B, and the lysosomal proteins, LAMP1 and p39, following 4 h of HBSS incubation. These protein levels were rescued by the overexpression of CREB5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 b</xref>).

This method, which we call AI-PS, reduces the time, cost, and complexity compared with standard screening methods that have required arrayed RNAi or CRISPR libraries. Recently, another study reported a similar concept that can be applied to detect the genetic profiles linking chemotaxis drugs and subcellular phenotypes (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hasle et al., 2020</xref>). Our study strengthens the value of photoactivation-based image screens and also shows that it can be used to investigate a large range of cell biology phenotypes.</p><p>The speed of AI-PS screening relies on the sequential execution of four steps: image capture, segmentation, generation of classification region of interest, and photoactivation of the region of interest. For a field of &#x0223c;200 cells, these four steps together take an average of 10 s, which is then iterated across an entire plate. Therefore, a screen of 600,000 cells infected with one seventh of the genome guide library, composed of 12,500 sgRNAs, takes &#x0223c;12 h. Hence, this accelerated platform, coupled with a user-friendly interface, should accelerate the utility of pooled genomic screens. The effective segmentation of live cells is critical in order to ensure efficiency in training and to avoid erroneous predictions. We found that the best way to segment mammalian cells by using the R package, EBImage, was to use two cellular markers in two different channels. Draq5 was used to mark the nuclei, which provided the seeds for segmentation. The other marker provides the cellular borders, or the cytosolic volume of the cell. The latter is important for the effective segmentation of a higher confluency of cells, which maximizes the number of cells screened. Similar two-channel approaches are commonly used in cellular segmentation (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">W&#x000e4;hlby et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Quelhas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Al-Kofahi et al., 2018</xref>). Three of the four most commonly differentiated channels are used for nuclei detection (far red), photoactivation (red), and CRISPR guide RNA expression (blue). Thus, AI-PS utilizes the remaining green/GFP channel to visualize both the phenotype queried and the cell borders. Deep learning models are becoming a more popular tool, but any gain in accuracy they provide is countered by the computational power and time required to deploy such models during the AI-PS segmentation step.</p><p>The method enables the detection and labeling of cells according to subcellular protein localization. We validated this by identifying PINK1 as the only known reported hit required for Parkin translocation to damaged mitochondria within the genome guide sublibrary of kinases, phosphatases, and the druggable genome, demonstrating the validity of the method.</p><p>We also used AI-PS to explore a completely different protein translocation process, one that again would be undetectable via FACS separation of whole cells based on a change in overall fluorescence intensity. The transcription factor, TFEB, is retained in the cytosol in growing cells and upon starvation relocalizes to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of lysosomal- and autophagy-related genes (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Settembre et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Sardiello et al., 2009</xref>). Upon prolonged starvation, TFEB returns to the cytosol via an undefined process. Either nuclear TFEB migrates back to the cytosol or nuclear TFEB is degraded while newly synthesized TFEB repopulates the cytosol. As we found minimal evidence for a role of cytoskeletal or nuclear transporter proteins, whether the appearance of TFEB in the cytosol is due to the physical shuttling of preexisting TFEB or to an increase in the translation of new TFEB remains an open question. Beyond protein localization screens, our method will be useful to identify genes involved in the regulation of organelle abundance, size, and shape.</p><p>Similar to the concepts presented in our study, machine learning&#x02013;based image analysis has been used for the calling and sorting of cells (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Ota et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Nitta et al., 2018</xref>); however, AI-PS conveys distinct advantages. First, the microscopic resolution of AI-PS is much higher than that used during dissociated cell sorting (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Ota et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Nitta et al., 2018</xref>), allowing for the identification of more difficult to detect subcellular structures. Specifically, the detection of minor subcellular events, such as an alteration in protein distribution, positioning, and motion, requires high spatial-temporal resolution image acquisition. Previously published methods used low magnification objectives (4&#x000d7; and 10&#x000d7;) and very short exposure times (&#x0003c;50 ms), which resulted in low signal-to-noise ratios and are not suitable for the resolution of subcellular events.</p><p>Another advantage of the AI-PS platform is its wide accessibility&#x02014;there is no need for specialized flow instrumentation, and the algorithms and code presented here can be adapted easily for a variety of microscope systems. AI-PS is compatible with adherent tissue culture cells, unlike sorting-based approaches for which cells must be in suspension, further allowing a more accurate examination of subcellular events in regular culture conditions. One current limitation of AI-PS is that the cells must be screened live to allow for trypsinization to produce single-cell suspension for FACS. Because some phenotypes would be better screened in fixed cells, we are developing methods that enable single-cell release of fixed cells to allow screening of additional cell biology processes. While machine learning methods require larger training datasets, they have a clear advantage over standard image analysis algorithms in the classification and prediction of subtle subcellular phenotypes. Classification models built with deep learning are less influenced by human bias, since they independently decide which image features are important for distinguishing between the two (or more) phenotypes.</p><p>The use of machine learning, photoconversion, and deep sequencing in separate applications is not new. Using our current method, we show improvement of the scalability of pooled optical screens in comparison to similar approaches already reported. However, we show that, compared with a previous pooled visual genetic screen (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Feldman et al., 2019</xref>), only 32% of the primary screen hits were validated to directly affect TFEB translocation in a secondary assay. We cannot rule out that this lower validation rate is a result of the large scale of the current screen which increases the complexity and might increase variation. In the future, in order to increase the discovery rate of large AI-PS screens, a few considerations are recommended. First, in the current study, we observed that increasing the biological replicates from three to five resulted in a significant power increase. Second, as discussed previously, faster and larger imaging fields will allow for greater screening sample sizes. In addition, from our flow cytometry data, we learned that &#x0003e;0.5% frequency of the desired cell phenotype decreases false positives.</p><p>Prediction of TFEB nuclear translocation by using the deep learning approach was more accurate than the SVM classification model, possibly because of discrepancies in classification accuracy owing to the uneven fluorescence intensity of the TFEB signal. Although the cell line was carefully generated from a single clone, over several passages the TFEB expression level diverged across the population. The use of low magnification objective (20&#x000d7;) with a low NA value of 0.75 further amplified these variations. To address this, unevenly illuminated images were introduced into our CNN classifier builder by adding an augmentation step to our image batch generator before training. In future screening designs, there are several steps that can be used to overcome this issue. First, knocking-in GFP into the TFEB or gene of interest locus may decrease expression variability. In addition, higher magnification objectives equipped with better NA lenses would decrease the illumination heterogenicity.</p><p>Another step to improve AI-PS would be to reduce the segmentation time per image to speed up the screen. Fortunately, a huge improvement in cell segmentation, specifically the development of deep learning&#x02013;based techniques, such as U-Net segmentation (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Caicedo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hollandi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Ronneberger et al., 2015</xref>), can be used in AI-PS. This new deep learning&#x02013;based segmentation has the potential for at least a fivefold reduction in analysis time. Increasing the speed will make it possible to increase the sample size, thereby increasing the sgRNA coverage in the sorted samples and decreasing the FDR. Another strategy for increasing specificity would be to use single-cell DNA sequence analysis. In the future, simultaneous imaging with two CEMOS cameras will reduce capture time. Finally, large-format camera sensors with larger field-of-view capturing will greatly improve the overall screen since more cells can be screened and analyzed. Another limitation of AI-PS is that to complete a whole-genome screen, we image 600,000 cell batches in three repeats. To minimize the overall screening time, we reduced the number of fields of view to be screened by seeding cells at 90% confluency. The high confluency allows more cells to be screened, but results in a slight reduction in the accuracy of segmentation. Therefore, to allow for longer screen image acquisition times and therefore lower cell seeding density, a major improvement will be to screen fixed cells with a reversible fixation method to allow cell sorting following photoactivation.</p><p>The tool we present here is best suited for low-phenotype alteration hit rates&#x02014;that is, when only 0.5% to 1% of cells are called per field of view captured to minimize photoactivation time. For example, in the current TFEB screen, a mean of three cells were detected and activated per field of view. Therefore, for the current screen, a galvo-miniscanner photoactivation unit was sufficient; however, in a scenario where the phenotype-altering hit rate is much higher, a faster photoactivation unit, such as a DMD illumination module, would be more suitable.</p><p>In conclusion, our platform demonstrates the novel implementation of machine learning to improve cell biology research and discovery, and enables phenotypic-based screening at the subcellular level, an approach largely unavailable previously. Additionally, AI-PS can be implemented for drug target exploration and may prove to be valuable in methods targeting single cells within complex human samples.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s12"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s13"><title>Cell lines, constructs, and reagents</title><p>U2OS and HEK293T cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with FBS (10% vol/vol; Gemini Bio Products), 10 mM Hepes (Life Technologies), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies), 1 mM nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies), and 2 mM glutamine (Life Technologies).

The next day (day 1), 20 &#x000b5;g/ml subpooled sgRNA plasmid, 14.1 &#x000b5;g/ml PAX2, 4.2 mg/ml MDG2, and 1.2 &#x000b5;g/ml pAdvantage (third-generation lentiviral vector packaging systems) were transfected by using 75 &#x000b5;l Lipofectamine 2000 (11668019; Thermo Fisher Scientific) in Opti-MEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific). On day 2, the medium was changed, and on day 3, the virus was harvested. A lentivirus precipitation kit (VC100; Alstem Cell Advancements) was used according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s suggestions to concentrate the virus.</p><p>To determine MOI, 0.10<sup>6</sup> cells were seeded in 24-well plates and infected with four titrations of the concentrated virus. Genomic DNA was isolated by using QIAamp DNA Micro Kit (56304; Qiagen). The number of genomic viral integration sites was compared with the number of housekeeping genes by using a Bio-Rad QX200 AutoDG Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) System (Bio-Rad). The volume to MOI ratio was calculated by using the following formula: insertion number (from ddPCR) &#x000d7; dilution factor = transducing units; (desired MOI &#x000d7; cell number)/transducing units = virus volume.</p><p>The ddPCR primer mix for amplifying upstream of the sgRNA integration region was purchased from Bio-Rad: GAA&#x0200b;GAA&#x0200b;GAA&#x0200b;GGT&#x0200b;GGA&#x0200b;GAG&#x0200b;AGA&#x0200b;GAC&#x0200b;AGA&#x0200b;GAC&#x0200b;AGA&#x0200b;TCC&#x0200b;ATT&#x0200b;CGA&#x0200b;TTA&#x0200b;GTG&#x0200b;AAC&#x0200b;GGA&#x0200b;TCG&#x0200b;GCA&#x0200b;CTG&#x0200b;CGT&#x0200b;GCG&#x0200b;CCA&#x0200b;ATT&#x0200b;CTG&#x0200b;CAG&#x0200b;ACA&#x0200b;AAT&#x0200b;GGC&#x0200b;AGT&#x0200b;ATT&#x0200b;CAT&#x0200b;CCA&#x0200b;CAA&#x0200b;TTT&#x0200b;TAA&#x0200b;AAG&#x0200b;AAA&#x0200b;AGG&#x0200b;GGG&#x0200b;G (FAM).

The next day, the appropriate virus volume was added to cells to achieve an MOI less than five. Two days after infection, sgRNA-expressing cells were sorted by using a 407-nm Laser and 450/50-nm filters. Following 4 d of growth, cells were reseeded in two-well screening chambers. To maintain sufficient sgRNA representation, cells were maintained at numbers corresponding to a coverage of at least 100 cells per sgRNA.</p></sec><sec id="s20"><title>Activated sample isolation</title><p>After screening, cells were detached by using Trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich), washed once with PBS, and filtered by using a 50-&#x003bc;m sieve (Corning) to obtain a single-cell suspension. The volume was adjusted to obtain up to 10 million cells per ml using PBS. Cells were kept in the dark on ice until sorting, which was done by using a BD FACS Aria cell sorter equipped with 355-nm, 407-nm, 532-nm, and 640-nm laser lines, and BD FACSDIVA software to perform aseptic cell sorting. Physical properties (forward-scatter and side-scatter parameters) of cells were used to identify and exclude debris, dead cells, and doublets. All single cells were then selected for GFP expression by using the signal from the 488-nm laser line 515/30-nm filters. mCherry signal was identified by using the 532-nm laser line and 610/25-nm filter, and BFP signal was identified by using signal from the 407-nm laser and 450/50-nm filters.

To construct the sequencing library, genomic DNA was amplified by two-step PCR. In the first step, unique modifier identifiers (UMIs) fused with lentiviral vector integration site (step 1 Fw primer) were mixed with 7i adaptor primer fused with lentiviral vector integration 3&#x02032; integration site (step 1 Rev primer). The mixture was amplified by using 5&#x02013;10 PCR cycles. The second amplification step included a forward primer complementary to the UMI primer fused to 5i (step 2 Fw primer) Illumina adaptor primers and 7i (step 2 Rev primer) and amplified by using 25 PCR cycles. DNA concentration was measured by using the NEBNext Library Quant Kit for Illumina (E7630L; New England Biolabs). Each 50-&#x000b5;l PCR reaction was composed of 0.5 &#x000b5;M primers, 0.5 &#x000b5;l of Phusion hot-start DNA polymerase (F549S; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 2.5 &#x000b5;M dNTPs (N0447S; New England Biolabs). After 25 cycles (second PCR step), the PCR products were cleaned by using AMPure beads (A63880; Beckman Coulter) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol.</p><p>Fragment size and purity were determined by using Agilent TapeStation 2200 and 4200 models, and the desired fragment size of 300 bp was extracted and eluted with a Pippin instrument (Sage Science) with HT 2% Agarose Gel, 100&#x02013;600 bp (HTC2010). For the Parkin screen, we used 300 v2 Cassettes (15 million reads) on MiSeq (MS-102-2002), whereas, for the TFEB screen, Illumina paired-end sequencing was performed on a NextSeq 550 instrument with a sequencing chip of 300 Mid Output Kit v2.5 (120 million reads, cat 20024905; Illumina).
