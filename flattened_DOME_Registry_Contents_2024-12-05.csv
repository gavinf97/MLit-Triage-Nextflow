A phylogeny was inferred using SATé-enabled phylogenetic placement, which was used to insert 16S Deblur sOTUs into Greengenes 13_8 at a 99% phylogeny.
2)	Raw LC-MS/MS data sets were converted to m/z extensible markup language (mzXML) in centroid mode using MSConvert. All mzXML files were cropped with an m/z range of 75.00 to 1,000.00 Da. Feature extraction was performed in MZmine2 with a signal intensity threshold of 2.0e5 and minimum peak width of 0.3 s. The maximum allowed mass and retention time tolerances were 10 ppm and 10 s, respectively. A local minimum search algorithm with a minimum relative peak height of 1% was used for chromatographic deconvolution; the maximum peak width was set to 1 min. The detected peaks were aligned across all samples using the above-mentioned retention time and mass tolerances, producing the final feature table used in these analyses. 
Molecular networking in GNPS was performed to putatively identify molecular features using MS/MS-based spectral library matches.

Manual, expert review on the MRI exams and performed 3D segmentations of the whole tumour in the first post-contrast non-subtracted sequence using ITK-Snot reportedP software.

Susceptibility artefacts related to post-biopsy changes, when
present, were excluded from segmentation and only the largest
lesion was segmented in multifocal tumours. 

Enhancement maps were calculated as the percentage increase in signal from the pre-contrast image to the first post-contrast image. Radiomics and statistical analysis were performed using MATLAB and publicly available CERR (Computational Environment for Radiological Research) software.

Furthermore, data was reduced to a fixed bin number of 16 grey levels and only an interpixel distance of one was considered. CERR analysis resulted in 102 texture parameters sub-divided into six categories - 22 first order statistics, 26 statistics based on grey level cooccurrence matrices, 16 statistics based on run length matrices, 16 statistics based on size zone matrices, 17 statistics based on neighborhood grey level dependence matrices, and finally five statistics based on neighborhood grey tone difference matrices.

Features were computed for each 2D directional matrix and averaged over 2D directions and slices, since data was not isotropic. As patients were scanned at different sites, Combat harmonisation was performed to remove the centre effect (local vs. foreign scans) while retaining the pathophysiologic information (either HER2 expression or pathologic response). The harmonisation employed Bayes estimates to account for both additive and multiplicative scanner effects.

Univariate analysis was performed to identify significant parameters. Continuous variables were described as mean, standard deviation (SD), and range. The two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test for two independent samples was used to determine significant differences between groups. Correlation analysis was then employed to remove redundant parameters from advancement to model development. If a highly positive (> 0.9) or highly negative (< -0.9) correlation was noted, the parameter with the lowest area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) was removed.

The initial raw training may have included some false positive and false negative genes, as it contained results from automated literature mining that is known to give noisy output. To optimize the performance, the following pruning of the raw training set was performed: 

1)	Only protein-coding genes in autosomes were kept, as non-protein coding genes or genes on sex chromosomes may be under different mechanism of epigenomic regulation.
2)	From the positive training set, genes with sufficient contradictory evidence were removed (ExAC pLI ≤ 0.1 and expected loss-of-function variants >1011).
3)	From the negative training set, genes with sufficient contradictory evidence (pLI ≥ 0.2 and expected loss-of-function variants>10) were removed.
","Epigenomic features critical for the prediction were determined by calculating a Spearman correlation coefficient between each epigenomic feature and Episcore (random forest model) prediction. 
 One epigenomic feature corresponds to a data type per certain tissue/cell type. To examine which data types are more important, these Spearman correlation coefficients were plotted by data type. 
 To examine what tissue/cell types are more important, the averaged z-score for each tissue/cell type was calculated by:
 1) Converting every Spearman correlation coefficient to a Z-score using mean and standard deviation specific to each data type and
 2) Average Z-scores from various data types for each tissue/cell type.

1)	For each gene, only TSS of Ensembl canonical transcripts were used.
2)	A GappedPeak was assigned to a TSS if the GappedPeak overlaps with the upstream 5 kb to downstream 1 kb region around the TSS. This definition of basal cis-regulatory region around promoter was according to GREAT tool. Assigning one GappedPeak to multiple TSS was allowed.
3)	For TSS having more than 1 GappedPeak assigned, only the closest one was kept.
4)	For genes with multiple TSS and hence multiple assigned GappedPeaks, only the longest GappedPeak was kept.
After these four steps, if one gene had been associated with a GappedPeak, then the width of the peak was used as an epigenomic feature in the following machine learning models. If a gene had no associated GappedPeak, then the peak width is 0.

Coverage of H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9me3, DNase I, and Rnot reported-seq data was used as input for EpiTensor to infer interacting enhancers across distant genomic regions. This was done as balance between more input data types and more cell types included, as not every cell type has all these histone modifications characterized.

Additionally, distance matrices were calculated for each tree, where the distance between two leaves corresponds to the sum of the branch lengths separating them. 

Comparing two trees can be subject to artefacts and lead in some cases to spurious correlations if speciation events are not taken in account. For this reason, some of the co-evolution features also involve the Tree of Life (ToL) of the 34 genomes studied, which originated from submitting sequences of their respective 16S ribosomal Rnot reported to similar treatment.

To mitigate the risk of overfitting in the CLL and cervical datasets, we utilized the Repeated Stratified K-fold Cross-Validation method.","
In this project, we utilized four different publicly available datasets that are well recognized in the domain. The first dataset consisted of mRNA data obtained from a study on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) patients, measuring their transcriptome profiles. The second dataset was collected from a cervical cancer study that analyzed the expression levels of 714 miRNAs in human samples. The third and fourth datasets were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and included mRNA and miRNA sequencing data from patients with Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA).

VPOD_1.0 is a new database, available on GitHub, that currently includes all heterologously expressed animal opsins.

The database contains opsin sequences and phenotype data from 166 unique species (counting 35 reconstructed ancestors), including fishes, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, crustaceans, and bivalves. Altogether, VPOD_het_1.0 contains 864 unique opsin sequences and corresponding λmax values.",,,10.1101/2024.02.12.579993,00e4d4f8-2dd6-452a-b27c-72fe9296b09d,"For model evaluation and comparison, deepBreaks by default uses a 10-fold cross-validation approach and ranks
the models based on their average cross-validation score.
As we described in the methods of the main text ""we created eleven data subsets with varying levels of taxonomic and gene family inclusivity (Table 1) to test which factors most impact the reliability/performance of ML methods. We used naming conventions that include versioning to improve reproducibility and reliability of individual datasets and models. For example, one subset combines ultraviolet and SWS opsins, which we named VPOD_uss_het_1.0. Our convention is to name the subset (in this case USS = ‘Ultraviolet and Short-wave Sensitive’ opsins); name the source of phenotype data (heterologous = het), and record the version number of the dataset (1.0). We also created subsets for medium- and long-wave sensitive opsins (VPOD_mls_het_1.0) and all rod (Rh1) and rod-like (Rh2) opsins (VPOD_rod_het_1.0). Other subsets use species taxonomy, one for vertebrates (VPOD_vert_het_1.0) and another for invertebrates (VPOD_inv_het_1.0). For taxonomic subsets, we considered all sequences from phylum Chordata as ‘vertebrates’ and the rest as 'invertebrates’. Another subset excludes all mutant opsin sequences, called ‘wild-types’ (VPOD_wt_het_1.0). A final named subset is the whole data set (VPOD_wds_het_1.0). 
Using various subsets of data, we performed a number of experiments to better understand the performance of ML models in predicting λmax. First, to better understand how training data relate to model performance, R2 , and training data size, we gradually increased the size of training datasets, using the WDS, Vertebrate, WT, and Rod subsets separately, by adding between 15-50 randomly selected sequences at a time, repeating the process three times per data split (Table S1). We then analyzed the fit between the size of training data sets (x-axis) and model performance (y-axis), comparing six non-linear models with AIC to find the model that best explains the observed variation (Figure S2). Second, to understand if ML could predict known phenotypic changes due to experimental mutations, we queried the top performing WT model (which lacks data from artificially mutated sequences) using all experimentally mutated opsins to predict their phenotypes. We plotted these results using matplotlib [49] to visualize characteristics of poorly predicted outliers (e.g., taxonomic bias or sensitivity to mutations which caused large shifts in λmax from the WT). Third, we examined the ability of our models to predict λmax of thirty invertebrate opsins not in VPOD_1.0 because they are only known from physiological studies (Table S3, Figure S4). Here, we collected data both characterized by single-cell microspectrophotometry (MSP) or electroretinogram methods and with expression localized to cell-type by in-situ-hybridization (ISH), to link λmax to a specific opsin (the sequences and metadata can be found in ‘msp_erg_raw.txt’ and ‘msp_erg_meta.tsv’, while the resulting predictions can be found under the ‘msp_tests’ folder on our GitHub repository). Finally, we directly compared predictive capabilities of models trained on different data subsets by randomly selecting and removing the same 25 wild-type ultraviolet or short-wave sensitive opsins from the training data of the WDS, Vertebrate, WT, and UVS/SWS models before training and querying the model with those same sequences following training (Table S3, Figure S5).

output. For xgboost and lightgbm the reported feature importance represents the number of times a feature appears in a tree. For AdaBoost, random forest, decision tree, extra tree, and

The default threshold is 80% of the number of samples.  Dropping the zero-entropy (constant) features from the dataset, is the next step.   deepBreaks uses one-hot encoding to convert amino acid sequences into numerical values. One consequence of this encoding is any amino acids at a given position in the alignment, which are not present at that position in any training data, will be treated equivalently as unseen. For example, cases of only A and V at a highly conserved site in the training set that are presented with a sequence with T at that site will be considered as no A and no V.

In this project, we utilized six different publicly available datasets that are well recognized in the domain. The first dataset consisted of mRNA data obtained from a study on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) patients, measuring their transcriptome profiles. The second dataset was collected from a cervical cancer study that analyzed the expression levels of 714 miRNAs in human samples. The third and fourth datasets were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and included mRNA and miRNA sequencing data from patients with Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA). 
  <br>
  <br>


The fifth dataset consists of scRNA-seq data obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) that were sequenced using 10× chromium technology. Among all the cell populations described in this study, we specifically utilized the scRNA datasets of CD8+ naïve, CD14+, and CD16+ monocytes (n=1500) with the goal of identifying distinct markers for each of these cell populations. The sixth dataset used in this study was the widely recognized Glass Identification dataset obtained from the University of California Irvine (UCI) ML repository.

For each MOB type of plasmid genome, the training and testing sets were divided in a 7:3 ratio. The training set for each MOB type randomly generated 90,000 simulated metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments, while the testing set for each MOB type randomly generated 500 simulated metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments.

Both of these methods are well-known in machine learning. Currently, methods used for MOB typing annotation rely on relaxase-based approaches such as MOB-suite and MOBscan. However, in metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments, relaxase sequences are often missing or incomplete. As a result, most plasmid assembly fragments are annotated as non-transferable plasmids. Due to differences in sequence features and host range among different MOB types, this study utilized the Skip-gram language model to digitally encode the biological patterns and features of metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments, resulting in significant performance improvements for MOBFinder. With a training dataset of up to 990,000 entries, Random Forest was used to prevent overfitting in training the MOB classification models. The combined use of these two algorithms effectively enhanced the performance of predicting MOB types in metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments.
