Radiomics and statistical analysis were performed using MATLAB and publicly available CERR (Computational Environment for Radiological Research) software.\n\nFurthermore, data was reduced to a fixed bin number of 16 grey levels and only an interpixel distance of one was considered. CERR analysis resulted in 102 texture parameters sub-divided into six categories - 22 first order statistics, 26 statistics based on grey level cooccurrence matrices, 16 statistics based on run length matrices, 16 statistics based on size zone matrices, 17 statistics based on neighborhood grey level dependence matrices, and finally five statistics based on neighborhood grey tone difference matrices.\n\nFeatures were computed for each 2D directional matrix and averaged over 2D directions and slices, since data was not isotropic. As patients were scanned at different sites, Combat harmonisation was performed to remove the centre effect (local vs. foreign scans) while retaining the pathophysiologic information (either HER2 expression or pathologic response). The harmonisation employed Bayes estimates to account for both additive and multiplicative scanner effects.\n\nUnivariate analysis was performed to identify significant parameters. Continuous variables were described as mean, standard deviation (SD), and range. The two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test for two independent samples was used to determine significant differences between groups. Correlation analysis was then employed to remove redundant parameters from advancement to model development.

Subsequently, 20 variables that were highly correlated with the drug response (remission) of each bDMARD were selected. After selecting variables based on data, we created a prediction model by training with a fixed set of 35 variables.

With a similar logic, binary variables such as comorbidities were coded as 1 if \u201cyes\u201d and 0 if \u201cno\u201d or \u201cno test\u201d because \u201cno\u201d was the most common value.",

To further reduce the effects of nuisance factors, signals from cerebrospinal fluid and white matter were also regressed out. \nDARTEL toolbox was used to normalize the data and the resulting images were finally smoothed with a 6-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel.\nThe time series within each ROI were first band-pass filtered (0.01\u20130.08 Hz) and then averaged.

To examine which data types are more important, these Spearman correlation coefficients were plotted by data type. \n To examine what tissue/cell types are more important, the averaged z-score for each tissue/cell type was calculated by:\n 1) Converting every Spearman correlation coefficient to a Z-score using mean and standard deviation specific to each data type and\n 2) Average Z-scores from various data types for each tissue/cell type.\n This analysis indicated that epigenomic features in stem cells, brain tissues, and fetal tissues contribute more to Episcore prediction than other features.",

The multiple sequence alignments were subsequently input in PhyML for the construction of phylogenetic trees using the Maximum Likelihood method. For amino acid and nucleotide-based tree construction in PhyML, the LG and HKY85 substitution matrices were used, respectively. Additionally, distance matrices were calculated for each tree, where the distance between two leaves corresponds to the sum of the branch lengths separating them. \n\nComparing two trees can be subject to artefacts and lead in some cases to spurious correlations if speciation events are not taken in account. For this reason, some of the co-evolution features also involve the Tree of Life (ToL) of the 34 genomes studied, which originated from submitting sequences of their respective 16S ribosomal Rnot reported to similar treatment. Since distances in the ToL are computed from a nucleotide-based substitution matrix, the distances in the ToL matrix were rescaled for proper comparison with the protein-based distance matrices.\n",

Let A and B be the two MCP ortholog groups, mA and mB their respective matrices, tA and tB their trees. The parameter mirrorAB is the correlation between mA and mB, mirrorA is between mA and ToL, and mirrorB is between mB and ToL. The fourth descriptor, mirrorAB-ToL, involves an adaptation of the mirror tree, also known as tol-mirror, which measures the correlation between mA and mB after removing the background similarity inherent to speciation events in the ToL.\nThe remaining 3 topological features are derived from the Icong index, defined as the probability that the Maximum Agreement Subtree (MAST) between two trees is arising by chance. Along the same idea, topological similarities were computed between tree A and ToL, tree B and ToL, and finally A and B (topA, topB, topAB).\n",

        "matches_optimization/encoding": "EEG signals are notch-filtered at 60 Hz to reduce line noise, and bandpass filtered from 0.5 Hz to 20 Hz to reduce myogenic artifacts.\nFor 30s-epochs, those with absolute amplitude larger than 500 m V are removed to minimize movement artifacts. Epochs containing flat EEG for more than 2 seconds are also removed. We also exclude EEGs contaminated by electrocardiogram, indicated by 1 Hz harmonic in the EEG spectrogram. To reduce interparticipant variance, the amplitude of each EEG channel is normalized to have zero median and unit interquartile range across the whole night. The total amount of data removed by these preprocessing procedures is\n7% in the MGH data set and 9% in the SHHS data set.",

The large size of the data sets helps to ensure the statistical power as well and to minimize selection bias. A large training set helps ensure that the trained model does not overfit to a particular data set, improving the ability togeneralize when applied beyond the training set. A large testing set allows accurate statistical measurement of how accurately the\nmodel performs.",

The data set contains 987 adults for a total of 1974 nights of EEG recorded. They trained the model in 2 ways. First, they trained the model on 752 participants with paired EEGs (1504 EEGs) from both visits and tested on the held out 235 participants with paired EEGs (470 EEGs) in both visits. They trained the model on the 2365 EEGs from healthy participants in MGH data set. We then predicted BA on the 1974 paired EEGs in SHHS as the testing set."

We used naming conventions that include versioning to improve reproducibility and reliability of individual datasets and models. For example, one subset combines ultraviolet and SWS opsins, which we named VPOD_uss_het_1.0. Our convention is to name the subset (in this case USS = \u2018Ultraviolet and Short-wave Sensitive\u2019 opsins); name the source of phenotype data (heterologous = het), and record the version number of the dataset (1.0). We also created subsets for medium- and long-wave sensitive opsins (VPOD_mls_het_1.0) and all rod (Rh1) and rod-like (Rh2) opsins (VPOD_rod_het_1.0). Other subsets use species taxonomy, one for vertebrates (VPOD_vert_het_1.0) and another for invertebrates (VPOD_inv_het_1.0). For taxonomic subsets, we considered all sequences from phylum Chordata as \u2018vertebrates\u2019 and the rest as 'invertebrates\u2019. Another subset excludes all mutant opsin sequences, called \u2018wild-types\u2019 (VPOD_wt_het_1.0). A final named subset is the whole data set (VPOD_wds_het_1.0). \nUsing various subsets of data, we performed a number of experiments to better understand the performance of ML models in predicting \u03bbmax. First, to better understand how training data relate to model performance, R2 , and training data size, we gradually increased the size of training datasets, using the WDS, Vertebrate, WT, and Rod subsets separately, by adding between 15-50 randomly selected sequences at a time, repeating the process three times per data split (Table S1). We then analyzed the fit between the size of training data sets (x-axis) and model performance (y-axis), comparing six non-linear models with AIC to find the model that best explains the observed variation (Figure S2). Second, to understand if ML could predict known phenotypic changes due to experimental mutations, we queried the top performing WT model (which lacks data from artificially mutated sequences) using all experimentally mutated opsins to predict their phenotypes. We plotted these results using matplotlib [49] to visualize characteristics of poorly predicted outliers (e.g., taxonomic bias or sensitivity to mutations which caused large shifts in \u03bbmax from the WT). Third, we examined the ability of our models to predict \u03bbmax of thirty invertebrate opsins not in VPOD_1.0 because they are only known from physiological studies (Table S3, Figure S4). Here, we collected data both characterized by single-cell microspectrophotometry (MSP) or electroretinogram methods and with expression localized to cell-type by in-situ-hybridization (ISH), to link \u03bbmax to a specific opsin (the sequences and metadata can be found in \u2018msp_erg_raw.txt\u2019 and \u2018msp_erg_meta.tsv\u2019, while the resulting predictions can be found under the \u2018msp_tests\u2019 folder on our GitHub repository). Finally, we directly compared predictive capabilities of models trained on different data subsets by randomly selecting and removing the same 25 wild-type ultraviolet or short-wave sensitive opsins from the training data of the WDS, Vertebrate, WT, and UVS/SWS models before training and querying the model with those same sequences following training (Table S3, Figure S5). \"\n",

Phylogenetic imputation uses maximum likelihood (we will not abbreviate maximum likelihood as ML to avoid confusion with machine learning), assuming Brownian Motion to predict missing phenotypes using a phylogenetic tree, assuming more closely related species or sequences have more similar phenotypes. We randomly removed 50 opsin sequences, and their corresponding \u03bbmax values from each of the training datasets used to train our ML models (with the exception of the smaller MWS/LWS and invertebrate datasets, in which we only removed 15), then estimated the removed \u03bbmax values using phylogenetic imputation.

The default threshold is 80% of the number of samples.  Dropping the zero-entropy (constant) features from the dataset, is the next step.   deepBreaks uses one-hot encoding to convert amino acid sequences into numerical values. One consequence of this encoding is any amino acids at a given position in the alignment, which are not present at that position in any training data, will be treated equivalently as unseen. For example, cases of only A and V at a highly conserved site in the training set that are presented with a sequence with T at that site will be considered as no A and no V. The models cannot distinguish the input whether it's T or other unseen amino acids at that site.  ",

This statistical test is used to assess the significance of each position by running tests on all the positions against the phenotype one by one. Those features where the p-value of their test against the phenotype is less than a threshold (default p-value = 0.25) will be dropped. A list of all features and their test p-values are provided a report to the user.

For xgboost and lightgbm the reported feature importance represents the number of times a feature appears in a tree.

Both of these methods are well-known in machine learning. Currently, methods used for MOB typing annotation rely on relaxase-based approaches such as MOB-suite and MOBscan. However, in metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments, relaxase sequences are often missing or incomplete. As a result, most plasmid assembly fragments are annotated as non-transferable plasmids. Due to differences in sequence features and host range among different MOB types, this study utilized the Skip-gram language model to digitally encode the biological patterns and features of metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments, resulting in significant performance improvements for MOBFinder. With a training dataset of up to 990,000 entries, Random Forest was used to prevent overfitting in training the MOB classification models. The combined use of these two algorithms effectively enhanced the performance of predicting MOB types in metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments. In some cases, F1 and AUC scores reached as high as 0.99, almost perfect.",

The two-layer neural network consists of a hidden layer with 100 neurons. Finally, 100-dimensional word vectors corresponding to 256 DNA 4-mer \"words\" were outputted. 2. Training of the MOB classification model: This study utilized known relaxases of MOB types to perform MOB typing on plasmid genomes, selecting plasmid genomes with confirmed MOB types based on their scores to construct benchmark datasets. For each MOB type of plasmid genome, the training and testing sets were divided in a 7:3 ratio. The training set for each MOB type randomly generated 90,000 simulated metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments, while the testing set for each MOB type randomly generated 500 simulated metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments.
