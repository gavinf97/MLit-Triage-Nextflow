The dataset contains 2048 drugs (training dataset).   The dataset had been previously used also in https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-45349-y.     The procedure in [ https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-45349-y ] was used to obtain classification labels for the cancer task (positive (anti-cancer drug)/negative (non anti-cancer drug): N_pos = 209 /N_neg = 1839 drugs).   
",,"A 5-fold cross-validation was performed to assess model performance. In each split, 20% of the data is kept as the test set; from the remaining 80%, 10% is used as a validation set to perform early stopping. All splits were generated stratifying samples with respect to labels.  To balance the positive/negative classes (only 10.2% of drugs are anticancer), the contribution of each class was re-scaled to the loss function so that it is inversely proportional to class frequencies of each class during training.  ","A  non-linear, multi-layer convolutional Graph Neural Network (GNN) was trained to encode drug features, which were then fed to a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to output a probability distribution.  The probability distributions were passed to a SVM for the binary classification of nodes. The training was end-to-end.","Yes. Hyperparameter settings for every method are reported. For neural models, hyperparameter candidates can be found in Table 1, Characteristics of the neural network models architecture can be found in text.","Initially, each drug (or food molecule) is represented by a graph G of human PPI (with 15135 nodes and 177848 edges), with one binary feature per node (1 for anti-cancer, 0 for non anti-cancer).     A vector representation of the graph G is computed using a Graph Encoder, i.e. a GNN, which learns the systemic effect of drugs (or food molecules) on the PPI network.

",The code to reproduce the results can be downloaded from GitHub (https://github.com/ggonzalezp/hyperfoods),"Training time is expressed as milliseconds per sample per epoch, to facilitate the estimation of the total training time the proposed neural models would need for a different dataset.","Transparent : The attribution recall score for the best performing model is computed, to assess whether the model predicts drugs as anticancer preferentially based on the feature values in cancer-related genes, and found to be very high (85%). This means that the graph neural model classifies drugs as anticancer preferentially based on the value of the input features in cancer-related genes, which adds to the biological plausibility of the model. In addition, 6 use cases were invetigated. For all 6 drugs studied, over-represented pathways successfully recovered pathways described in the literature along with cancer-related
 pathways. This means that the representations learned capture the mechanisms of action of drugs.","Regression is the output by neural networks, i.e. a probability distribution for anticancer/non-anticancer categories), which is taken in input by SVM for a binary classification output.",Yes.

F1 score and AUPR were significantly higher with the adopted models.","Confidence intervals and statistical significance are reported. Statistically significant higher performance measures were obtained by the used model, relative to the baseline method and to the method without network propagation used in https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-45349-y.","Balanced accuracy, F1 score, AUPR. The last two are used as parameters which better capture the performance of a classifier in the case of a highly-imbalanced dataset.","Cross-validation. The model was also tested on an independent dataset of 7793 food molecules, for their classification as anti-cancer or not anti-cancer, available for future experimental tests. The model outputs a high anticancer likelihood for a given food molecule if said molecule acts on the interactome through similar mechanisms of action as those of FDA-approved anticancer drugs. Among the anticancer-predicted molecules, e.g. genistein and pterostilbene show the most promise as cancer preventing agents, as indicated by substantial experimental evidence, gained from the literature."

Table 1. This table shows the fifteen most important features identified by the different classifiers.
-Based on this it can be inferred that the models had at least 15x features but does not list all or the total number.

Feature selection seems to have been done as the author notes that they ranked the features by their apparent importance to each model.","Potentially models were overfit.

-However, the exact model type not mentioned or clear.
-Text refers to the model used as 'ANRS', a computer based interpretation algorithm was built by the French ANRS (Agence Nationale de Recherches sur le SIDA; National Agency for AIDS Research). ANRS classifies ARV resistance according to three levels: susceptible, intermediate, and resistant. ‘Susceptible’ indicates that a particular ARV drug will be effective against HIV; ‘intermediate’ indicates that the ARV drug is partially effective; and if the ARV is not effective at all, it is classified ‘resistant’.
-Further online searches do not clearly yield information on this model.",Configuration not available.,No information in text on how the genotype seqs or phenotype data was encoded for the model.,"Unclear from text - not explicitly stated. Text suggests after feature selection the top 10 features were selected for the model.

Nneg=32 patients with tumours that showed HER2 gene amplification detected by FISH in the absence of protein overexpression on IHC (IHC 2+ or 1+ to 2+; FISH group).

Manual, expert review on the MRI exams and performed 3D segmentations of the whole tumour in the first post-contrast non-subtracted sequence using ITK-Snot reportedP software.

Susceptibility artefacts related to post-biopsy changes, when
present, were excluded from segmentation and only the largest
lesion was segmented in multifocal tumours. 

Enhancement maps were calculated as the percentage increase in signal from the pre-contrast image to the first post-contrast image. Radiomics and statistical analysis were performed using MATLAB and publicly available CERR (Computational Environment for Radiological Research) software.

Furthermore, data was reduced to a fixed bin number of 16 grey levels and only an interpixel distance of one was considered. CERR analysis resulted in 102 texture parameters sub-divided into six categories - 22 first order statistics, 26 statistics based on grey level cooccurrence matrices, 16 statistics based on run length matrices, 16 statistics based on size zone matrices, 17 statistics based on neighborhood grey level dependence matrices, and finally five statistics based on neighborhood grey tone difference matrices.

Features were computed for each 2D directional matrix and averaged over 2D directions and slices, since data was not isotropic. As patients were scanned at different sites, Combat harmonisation was performed to remove the centre effect (local vs. foreign scans) while retaining the pathophysiologic information (either HER2 expression or pathologic response). The harmonisation employed Bayes estimates to account for both additive and multiplicative scanner effects.

Univariate analysis was performed to identify significant parameters. Continuous variables were described as mean, standard deviation (SD), and range. The two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test for two independent samples was used to determine significant differences between groups. Correlation analysis was then employed to remove redundant parameters from advancement to model development. If a highly positive (> 0.9) or highly negative (< -0.9) correlation was noted, the parameter with the lowest area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) was removed.

Determination of exact number of training and test data points is difficult to ascertain due to poor alignment with numeric figures provided in the text to that of Table 2 which contains this information.

Neither sets of numbers align exactly to the text and no clear key/description provided. 

Dataset reuse/community recognised: data used is a subset of avilable data from reputable international databases. Large variety of databases leveraged and combined for training and test data.","How were the sets split?: 
For the training data:
-Validation set (25%): A quarter of the training data is used to fine-tune the model during training (resilient propagation method).
-Cross-validation (10-fold): The training data is divided into 10 folds. The model is trained on 9 folds and tested on the remaining one, repeated 10 times, to assess generalisability (AUC-ROC).

Are the training and test sets independent?: 
Yes, indpendent test and training sets used.

How does the distribution compare to previously published ML datasets?:

Test data sets: 
2x test data sets were used to test the models classification efficacy.
1. Somatic mutation test sets: consisting of two sets of putatively damaging cancer causing somatic variants derived from information in COSMIC AND dbCID databases. Text seems to indicate 576 test data points based on the final sentence '(n = 576)' but not clear or explictly stated/documented in text.  

2. De novo mutation test sets: consisting of non-frameshifting insertion/deletion variants curated from families affected by Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Data sourced from REACH Project (2650 families) and the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC). Final test set after filtering is performed is composed of 1217 candidate de novo indels in 827 offspring (506 cases, 321 controls).

Separate validation set used, and if yes, how large was it?: 
The model training utilised the resilient propagation method and 25% of training data set aside for the validation.",The ML algorithm used in the paper is an ensemble of bagged two-layer feed-forward neural networks.,"No, not clearly available from the text or software website. Regarding parameters reporting, the text does note: 'Each pathogenicity predictor was developed with the Matlab 2016b Neural Network Toolbox as an ensemble of one hundred bagged two-layer feed-forward neural networks, where the following training parameters were not varied between alternative models'.",Preprocessing was undertaken via Two-sample t-test and principal component analysis (PCA). Encoding used and detailed under feature engineering section such as numerical encoding.,Precise number of input features not explicitly stated in main publication text. The structural and functional features of protein sequences are detailed in Table 3 of the text and fall into 5x categories with approximately 57 noted across these categories. ,"Provided that the feature information and inferred parameter infromation (not easy to discern from text), the risk of overfitting is not very likely due to N >> p and the validation set. For underfitting this is mitigated by minimal feature reduction and 10-fold cross-validation employed, but this is dependent on significance of the features and risk grows if the features used are not significant enough. ",,"Without the precise feature count the number of parameters cannot be exactly determined. However, if to use the estimated number of features from Table 3 in the text (57 features from total of 5x categories), it could be inferred that with a network architecture of a two-layer feed-forward neural network with 10 hidden units would be 591.","Yes, as the text mentions using a validation set, specifically retaining 25% of the training data being set aside for validation.",Source code GitHub repository for MutPred2: https://github.com/vpejaver/mutpred2 - MIT License. Primary resource website of the software (http://mutpred.mutdb.org/) offers  live web service for analyses and downloadable executable.,"The standalone model executable can be used for genome-scale data sets. To install and run MutPred2, you will need about 50 GB of hard disk space and at least 4 GB RAM. No further information avaialble regarding prediction run times beyond this.","Somewhat of a black box from the text alone. In the text there are reasonable descriptions of the model but given the lack of publicly available model & code (eg: in Huggingface/other model hosting/no GitHub) and exact training & test datasets. It is somewhat of a blackbox if attempting to reproduce and interpret the exacts of the model given its complex ML algorithm nature being that of an ensemble of neural networks from the text alone. However, there is a GitHub online that can be found for the model and related datasets so this helps greatly with the model interpretability in conjunction with the text. However, it should be explictly linked for readers. The Matlab related files and info also not available on GitHub due to licensing.",Classification - used to predict pathogenicity of indels,No - no link/files /statistical code relating to the raw evaluation beyond text details.,"Yes, the evaluation of MutPred-Indel included comparisons to both simpler baselines and publicly available methods.

Simpler baseline: authors compared MutPred-Indel to MutPred2. They achieved this by simulating deletions and insertions using MutPred2 and showed that MutPred-Indel outperformed MutPred2 in this scenario (AUC of 0.903 vs 0.797)

Comparison to publicly available methods: authors also compared MutPred-Indel to other indel prediction methods like VEST-Indel and DDIG. MutPred-Indel achieved the highest AUC (0.897) compared to VEST-Indel (0.875) and DDIG-in (0.869). ",Confidence intervals are not explicitly mentioned in the text. No clear indication of t-tests/other approaches to determine statistically significant method improvements beyond the direct AUC comparisons.,"The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is detailed and plotted in the evalaution section.

The paper notes the model: 'shows strong performance in cross-validation with the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.908'. Figure 5 details the performance ROC curves under various comparisons such as against other prediction models such as 'CADD'.","Various evaluation methods were employed such as:
10-fold cross-validation, per-protein and per-cluster cross-validation and comparison of models with different feature sets."

The initial raw training may have included some false positive and false negative genes, as it contained results from automated literature mining that is known to give noisy output. To optimize the performance, the following pruning of the raw training set was performed: 

1)	Only protein-coding genes in autosomes were kept, as non-protein coding genes or genes on sex chromosomes may be under different mechanism of epigenomic regulation.
2)	From the positive training set, genes with sufficient contradictory evidence were removed (ExAC pLI ≤ 0.1 and expected loss-of-function variants >1011).
3)	From the negative training set, genes with sufficient contradictory evidence (pLI ≥ 0.2 and expected loss-of-function variants>10) were removed.

GitHub website. https://github.com/ShenLab/episcore,"For promoter features (H2A.Z, H3K27me3, H3K4me3, and H3K9ac), GappedPeaks were used to allow for broad domains of ChIP-seq signal. The assignment of a GapppedPeak to a gene followed these steps in order: 
1)	For each gene, only TSS of Ensembl canonical transcripts were used.
2)	A GappedPeak was assigned to a TSS if the GappedPeak overlaps with the upstream 5 kb to downstream 1 kb region around the TSS. This definition of basal cis-regulatory region around promoter was according to GREAT tool. Assigning one GappedPeak to multiple TSS was allowed.
3)	For TSS having more than 1 GappedPeak assigned, only the closest one was kept.
4)	For genes with multiple TSS and hence multiple assigned GappedPeaks, only the longest GappedPeak was kept.
After these four steps, if one gene had been associated with a GappedPeak, then the width of the peak was used as an epigenomic feature in the following machine learning models. If a gene had no associated GappedPeak, then the peak width is 0.

Coverage of H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9me3, DNase I, and Rnot reported-seq data was used as input for EpiTensor to infer interacting enhancers across distant genomic regions. This was done as balance between more input data types and more cell types included, as not every cell type has all these histone modifications characterized.
","The widths of called ChIP-seq peaks was used as promoter features. The counts of the interacting number of promoters and enhancers within pre-defined topologically associated domains (TADs) as enhancer features.
Specifically, the results of peak width and number of interacting enhancers were consolidated into a matrix, with each row being a gene and each column representing a combination of a tissue and a data type, e.g. “H3K4me3 peak width in fetal heart”. One combination of a tissue and a data type was referred to as one epigenomic feature. This matrix was used as input for the machine learning models.

 One epigenomic feature corresponds to a data type per certain tissue/cell type. To examine which data types are more important, these Spearman correlation coefficients were plotted by data type. 
 To examine what tissue/cell types are more important, the averaged z-score for each tissue/cell type was calculated by:
 1) Converting every Spearman correlation coefficient to a Z-score using mean and standard deviation specific to each data type and
 2) Average Z-scores from various data types for each tissue/cell type.
 This analysis indicated that epigenomic features in stem cells, brain tissues, and fetal tissues contribute more to Episcore prediction than other features.","Binary predictions.

Supporting information.,"Training dataset of 40 pairs of Pdu protein sequences whose presence or absence of physical, protein-protein interactions (PPIs) could be experimentally validated via binding assays, complementation and expression studies or crystallographic data.

Testing dataset of protein orthologs collected from 34 bacterial genomes in the KEGG database and collapsed among 22 orthologous protein groups, which represent types of bacterial microcompartment (MCP) proteins known to be associated with the propanediol utilizing (Pdu) system.
","Incomplete or erroneous annotations of the Pdu gene products were corrected after sequence comparison with the Pdu operon from Salmonella enterica LT2, the best-characterized strain in terms of Pdu MCP.","For the training set, Npos=16 interacting and Nneg=24 non-interacting protein pairs.
For the testing set, pairwise combinations of the 22 orthologous protein groups resulted in 231 unique protein pairs that needed to be classified.
",Random Forest classifier,,"For each ortholog group, its corresponding protein sequences were aligned with MUSCLE. The multiple sequence alignments were subsequently input in PhyML for the construction of phylogenetic trees using the Maximum Likelihood method. For amino acid and nucleotide-based tree construction in PhyML, the LG and HKY85 substitution matrices were used, respectively. Additionally, distance matrices were calculated for each tree, where the distance between two leaves corresponds to the sum of the branch lengths separating them. 

Comparing two trees can be subject to artefacts and lead in some cases to spurious correlations if speciation events are not taken in account. For this reason, some of the co-evolution features also involve the Tree of Life (ToL) of the 34 genomes studied, which originated from submitting sequences of their respective 16S ribosomal Rnot reported to similar treatment. Since distances in the ToL are computed from a nucleotide-based substitution matrix, the distances in the ToL matrix were rescaled for proper comparison with the protein-based distance matrices.
","For each protein pair, 7 coevolution features measuring the pairwise tree similarities have been defined. 
Of these, 4 features are based on pairwise comparison of the distance matrices, as defined in the mirrortree approach, and whose metrics correspond to the linear correlation coefficient between the two matrices in consideration. Let A and B be the two MCP ortholog groups, mA and mB their respective matrices, tA and tB their trees. The parameter mirrorAB is the correlation between mA and mB, mirrorA is between mA and ToL, and mirrorB is between mB and ToL. The fourth descriptor, mirrorAB-ToL, involves an adaptation of the mirror tree, also known as tol-mirror, which measures the correlation between mA and mB after removing the background similarity inherent to speciation events in the ToL.
The remaining 3 topological features are derived from the Icong index, defined as the probability that the Maximum Agreement Subtree (MAST) between two trees is arising by chance. Along the same idea, topological similarities were computed between tree A and ToL, tree B and ToL, and finally A and B (topA, topB, topAB).

As validation, they used a subset of the SHHS data set where each participant underwent 2 study visits, referred as SHHS1 and SHHS2. The data set contains 987 adults for a total of 1974 nights of EEG recorded. They trained the model in 2 ways. First, they trained the model on 752 participants with paired EEGs (1504 EEGs) from both visits and tested on the held out 235 participants with paired EEGs (470 EEGs) in both visits. They trained the model on the 2365 EEGs from healthy participants in MGH data set. We then predicted BA on the 1974 paired EEGs in SHHS as the testing set.",Novel approach: They develop a machine learning model to predict BA based on 2 large sleep EEG data sets. The model is described in the paper.,"yes, included in the paper.","EEG signals are notch-filtered at 60 Hz to reduce line noise, and bandpass filtered from 0.5 Hz to 20 Hz to reduce myogenic artifacts.
For 30s-epochs, those with absolute amplitude larger than 500 m V are removed to minimize movement artifacts. Epochs containing flat EEG for more than 2 seconds are also removed. We also exclude EEGs contaminated by electrocardiogram, indicated by 1 Hz harmonic in the EEG spectrogram. To reduce interparticipant variance, the amplitude of each EEG channel is normalized to have zero median and unit interquartile range across the whole night. The total amount of data removed by these preprocessing procedures is
7% in the MGH data set and 9% in the SHHS data set.","They extract 102 features from each 30-second epoch covering both time and frequency domains. For each EEG recording, they average the features in each of the 5 sleep stages overtime, yielding 102 x 5 = 510 features per EEG.","One strength of the study is the use of large data sets. The number of EEGs involved in this study is large among relevant “BA” studies. The large size of the data sets helps to ensure the statistical power as well and to minimize selection bias. A large training set helps ensure that the trained model does not overfit to a particular data set, improving the ability togeneralize when applied beyond the training set. A large testing set allows accurate statistical measurement of how accurately the
model performs.",,"one. To determine the optimal hyperparameter, they randomly select 300 EEGs from the training set to serve as internal validation data.",,,,"Transparent. The use of a parametric model, improves model interpretation by inspecting each EEG feature and comparing to the age norm for each feature explicitly.

-K-mer size: the text mentions using k-mers of size 6 (6-mers) for feature extraction.
-Subsequence length: the model used two subsequence lengths - 2kb and 5kb.

4x nucleotides (A, T, G, C) means a 6-mer can have 4^6 = 4096 possible combinations.
The text notes they only considered the ""canonical"" k-mer - the lexicographically highest version (e.g., ""AAAAAA"" instead of ""TTTTTT""). This reduces the number of features by half (assuming even distribution of nucleotides).

1. Logistic regression = unkown, but uses a single weight vector with a dimension equal to the number of features.

2. Random forest   = 200 (based on 200 decision trees noted in the final model.)

3. eXtreme Gradient Boosting - XGBoost  = unkown, little information in text

-Hyperparameter tuning & computational Resources seem to have been considered for parameter selection.
",10-fold cross-validation was one of the key approaches technique used to prevent overfitting. For the neural network specifically two other approaches were mentioned in the text to avoid overfitting: drop-out layers (these were applied to the first 4x layers to prevent co-adaptation and encourage generalisable features.) and L2 weight regularisation (model used a value of 0.0001 to penalise large weights to prevent overfitting.).,"Github containing model source code available: https://github.com/BV-BRC-dependencies/zou-plasmid-prediction.

VPOD_1.0 is a new database, available on GitHub, that currently includes all heterologously expressed animal opsins. We refer to a subset of the database with only heterologous data as VPOD_het_1.0, although for version 1.0, this is synonymous with the entire database. VPOD_het_1.0 relies on 68 publications, mainly primary sources, with dates ranging from the 1980’s to 2023. The database contains opsin sequences and phenotype data from 166 unique species (counting 35 reconstructed ancestors), including fishes, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, crustaceans, and bivalves.

For example, one subset combines ultraviolet and SWS opsins, which we named VPOD_uss_het_1.0 (n=280). Our convention is to name the subset (in this case USS = ‘Ultraviolet and Short-wave Sensitive’ opsins); name the source of phenotype data (heterologous = het), and record the version number of the dataset (1.0). We also created subsets for medium- and long-wave sensitive opsins (VPOD_mls_het_1.0)(n=91) and all rod (Rh1) and rod-like (Rh2) opsins (VPOD_rod_het_1.0)(n=352).

","For model training, a whole dataset it submitted to the algorithm training pipeline and it is randomly sampled to split the data such  that 80% is used for training, and 20% is used for model validation. The amount of data points in these splits/sets are dependent on the subset of data used to train the models. As mentioned earlier, VPOD_het_1.0 contains 864 unique opsin sequences and corresponding λmax values. From this we created eleven data subsets with varying levels of taxonomic and gene family inclusivity to test which factors most impact the reliability/performance of ML methods.","We then trained various ML models employing a custom version of deepBreaks, an ML tool designed for exploring genotype-phenotype associations. For continuous phenotypes, deepBreaks fit models using twelve different existing ML linear regression algorithms including, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Bayesian Regression, Lasso Least Angle Regression, Huber Regressor, Extremely Randomized Trees (Extra Trees), Extreme Gradient Boosting (xgboost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (lightgbm), Random Forest, Decision Tree, and AdaBoost. deepBreaks takes aligned genotype data (DNA, RNA, Amino Acid) and some measure(s) of corresponding continuous or categorical phenotype data as input to train ML models. ","Yes, they are likely available in the scikit-learn documentation. ","The deepBreaks pipeline for preprocessing starts with dropping columns in the dataset that contain missing values over a certain threshold. The default threshold is 80% of the number of samples.  Dropping the zero-entropy (constant) features from the dataset, is the next step.   deepBreaks uses one-hot encoding to convert amino acid sequences into numerical values. One consequence of this encoding is any amino acids at a given position in the alignment, which are not present at that position in any training data, will be treated equivalently as unseen. For example, cases of only A and V at a highly conserved site in the training set that are presented with a sequence with T at that site will be considered as no A and no V. The models cannot distinguish the input whether it's T or other unseen amino acids at that site.  ","The number of input features is variable depending on the length of the sequences following sequences alignment and the many preprocessing and feature selection steps. deepBreaks uses the Kruskal-Wallis tests (for continuous phenotypes)  to reduce the number of positions in the training data set and drop the redundant ones. This statistical test is used to assess the significance of each position by running tests on all the positions against the phenotype one by one. Those features where the p-value of their test against the phenotype is less than a threshold (default p-value = 0.25) will be dropped. A list of all features and their test p-values are provided a report to the user. Then, since deepBreaks considers each position in the sequences as a feature of our training dataset,  it checks for collinearity between our predictive variables, as it can cause issues for parameter estimation. To check for the relationship between
","We did not focus on ruling out overfitting or underfitting, however these features may be present in the scikit-learn backend. ",,For all of the above-mentioned models deepBreaks by default uses the default hyperparameters from the scikit-learn library in python and a grid search (expandable by user preference) parameter set that is provided in the documentation.,"We did not directly impliment any regularization measures, however I know certain models like the Light Gradient Boosted Machine and Xtreme Gradient Boosted Machine algorithms have regularization terms/parameters to limit overfitting.  That said, more information on this can be found in the scikit-learn documentation or in the corresponding literature for each machine learning algorithm type. ","As mentioned earlier, all software, code and supporting data are available on our GitHub repository (10.5281/zenodo.10667840 or https://github.com/VisualPhysiologyDB/visual-physiology-opsin-db/). All data and code (software) is covered under a GNU General Public License (Version 3), in accordance with Open Source Initiative (OSI)-policies. ","A single representative prediction, all the way to several hundred predictions, takes only a matter of seconds to complete on a normal desktop PC.  Additionally, training the models can completed in a matter of minutes on a desktop PC as well.  ","All models used are generally interpretable, primarily due to the nature of the feature selection process, treating each position on an amino acid sequence as a feature. 
For interpreting the contribution of sequence positions to the predictive models, we use the feature importance, coefficients, and weights as different algorithms have different kinds of
output. For xgboost and lightgbm the reported feature importance represents the number of times a feature appears in a tree. For AdaBoost, random forest, decision tree, extra tree, and
gradient boosting the importance of a feature is its Gini importance which is computed as the
normalized total reduction of the criterion brought by that feature.","The models used for our paper were all regression, but deepBreaks provides the option to also train classification models in an identical manner. ","Yes, this all available on our GitHub repository, (10.5281/zenodo.10667840 or https://github.com/VisualPhysiologyDB/visual-physiology-opsin-db/).","We didn't compare to an existing publicly available ML methods. However, we compared performance of ML models to phylogenetic imputation, which estimates phenotypes using phylogenetic information. Phylogenetic imputation uses maximum likelihood (we will not abbreviate maximum likelihood as ML to avoid confusion with machine learning), assuming Brownian Motion to predict missing phenotypes using a phylogenetic tree, assuming more closely related species or sequences have more similar phenotypes. We randomly removed 50 opsin sequences, and their corresponding λmax values from each of the training datasets used to train our ML models (with the exception of the smaller MWS/LWS and invertebrate datasets, in which we only removed 15), then estimated the removed λmax values using phylogenetic imputation. We used the phylogenetic imputation sub-module of the phytools R package for performing imputation. We compared imputed and actual λmax using regression. ",,The default performance metrics for regression and classification that deepBreaks uses are Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and F-score. The default list of metrics that deepBreaks reports are provided in the documentation provide predefined custom metrics or a set of metrics from the scikit-learn library in python.,"For model evaluation and comparison, deepBreaks by default uses a 10-fold cross-validation approach and ranks
the models based on their average cross-validation score.
As we described in the methods of the main text ""we created eleven data subsets with varying levels of taxonomic and gene family inclusivity (Table 1) to test which factors most impact the reliability/performance of ML methods. We used naming conventions that include versioning to improve reproducibility and reliability of individual datasets and models. For example, one subset combines ultraviolet and SWS opsins, which we named VPOD_uss_het_1.0. Our convention is to name the subset (in this case USS = ‘Ultraviolet and Short-wave Sensitive’ opsins); name the source of phenotype data (heterologous = het), and record the version number of the dataset (1.0). We also created subsets for medium- and long-wave sensitive opsins (VPOD_mls_het_1.0) and all rod (Rh1) and rod-like (Rh2) opsins (VPOD_rod_het_1.0). Other subsets use species taxonomy, one for vertebrates (VPOD_vert_het_1.0) and another for invertebrates (VPOD_inv_het_1.0). For taxonomic subsets, we considered all sequences from phylum Chordata as ‘vertebrates’ and the rest as 'invertebrates’. Another subset excludes all mutant opsin sequences, called ‘wild-types’ (VPOD_wt_het_1.0). A final named subset is the whole data set (VPOD_wds_het_1.0). 
Using various subsets of data, we performed a number of experiments to better understand the performance of ML models in predicting λmax. First, to better understand how training data relate to model performance, R2 , and training data size, we gradually increased the size of training datasets, using the WDS, Vertebrate, WT, and Rod subsets separately, by adding between 15-50 randomly selected sequences at a time, repeating the process three times per data split (Table S1). We then analyzed the fit between the size of training data sets (x-axis) and model performance (y-axis), comparing six non-linear models with AIC to find the model that best explains the observed variation (Figure S2). Second, to understand if ML could predict known phenotypic changes due to experimental mutations, we queried the top performing WT model (which lacks data from artificially mutated sequences) using all experimentally mutated opsins to predict their phenotypes. We plotted these results using matplotlib [49] to visualize characteristics of poorly predicted outliers (e.g., taxonomic bias or sensitivity to mutations which caused large shifts in λmax from the WT). Third, we examined the ability of our models to predict λmax of thirty invertebrate opsins not in VPOD_1.0 because they are only known from physiological studies (Table S3, Figure S4). Here, we collected data both characterized by single-cell microspectrophotometry (MSP) or electroretinogram methods and with expression localized to cell-type by in-situ-hybridization (ISH), to link λmax to a specific opsin (the sequences and metadata can be found in ‘msp_erg_raw.txt’ and ‘msp_erg_meta.tsv’, while the resulting predictions can be found under the ‘msp_tests’ folder on our GitHub repository). Finally, we directly compared predictive capabilities of models trained on different data subsets by randomly selecting and removing the same 25 wild-type ultraviolet or short-wave sensitive opsins from the training data of the WDS, Vertebrate, WT, and UVS/SWS models before training and querying the model with those same sequences following training (Table S3, Figure S5).

The analytic code is accessible from the GigaDB.","We collected 6,735 RNA viruses from Virus-Host Database and 126,417 records with host annotations from NCBI GenBank, both of which are widely used database. After the careful data preprocessings, including de-replication and removal of ambiguous host annotations, we finally got 14500 RNA viruses, spanning 30 virus orders and 12 host groups, including Invertebrate, Viridiplantae, Fungi, Bacteria, Primates, Rodentia, Artiodactyla, Carnivora, Other mammalia, Aves, Reptilia, and Fish. We also evaluated our method in a set of newly-identified RNA viruses, whose hosts are derived based on experimental evidence. The set includes 126 RNA viruses and were collected from various hosts, including Plant, Invertebrate, Fungi, and Fish. The dataset is complied from 20 publications.","We evalaute the model by cross-validation, leave-one-genus-out experiment and recently-identified viruses, which are not included in the training data. In all datasets, the training and test sets are independent. Before the evaluation, we remove the data redundancy to be less than 90% coverage and 80% identity. In leave-one-genus-out experiment and recently-identified viruses, the sequence identity between training and test set is even lower. ","We first evalute the learning architecture by stratified 5-fold cross validation. The viruses in corresponding virus orders are stratified splited into 5 folds by their labels, with 4 folds as training set and 1 as test set. We evaluated the models on each fold and average the results. There is no duplicate samples between the training and test datasets. 
Besides, we evaluated the models by conducting leave-one-genus-out experiments. Specifically, we used one genus as test set and viruses from other genuses as training set to assess the generalizability of the models. There are 448 virus genera in total. This experiment is a strong demonstration of the generality of the model; no viruses of the same genus are distributed in both the training and test data. ","We designated XGBoost as the learning architecture out of its superiors accuracy and training efficiency. To validate our choice, we conducted an evaluation of several learning architectures, encompassing XGBoost, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine with RBF kernel (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB). Using the scikit-learn and xgboost package, default parameters were employed to train these models, and their performance was assessed using accuracy as the evaluation metric.","All of the model configuration can be easily access from the scikit-learn and xgboost documentation. If you wanna check the parameters of our models, you may load the models by pickle package and used the command ""model.get_xgb_params()""","We encode the query sequences by their genomic traits and sequence homology. Specifically, we encode the sequences into a (137+m) dimensional vector as the input to models, where m is the number of host labels in the corresponding virus order and model layer. The genomic traits is vectorized as a 137-dimensional vector. To encode the m feature, we first group the reference viruses by their host labels, and then align the query virus against the reference viruses. The highest similarity score against each group is kept to be the corresponding feature value.","Two groups of feature are used as input, 137 genomic traits and the viral sequence homology. Although we did feature selection, we simply compared the feature contribution and model accuracy between the 137 genomic tratis and the codon pairs groups. This is done in the cross validation experiment. For a fair comparison, we removed all of the codon pair scores without using any relatively important ones, which will not result in the data leakage.","We did not focus on ruling out overfitting or underfitting. However, it is worth noting that the parameter count of XGBoost is typically lower than that of neural networks.

In this project, we utilized six different publicly available datasets that are well recognized in the domain. The first dataset consisted of mRNA data obtained from a study on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) patients, measuring their transcriptome profiles. The second dataset was collected from a cervical cancer study that analyzed the expression levels of 714 miRNAs in human samples. The third and fourth datasets were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and included mRNA and miRNA sequencing data from patients with Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA).

  <br>


The fifth dataset consists of scRNA-seq data obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) that were sequenced using 10× chromium technology. Among all the cell populations described in this study, we specifically utilized the scRNA datasets of CD8+ naïve, CD14+, and CD16+ monocytes (n=1500) with the goal of identifying distinct markers for each of these cell populations. The sixth dataset used in this study was the widely recognized Glass Identification dataset obtained from the University of California Irvine (UCI) ML repository.

Currently, you can use and view the MOBFinder tool on Github: https://github.com/MOBFinder",All plasmid genomes were downloaded from NCBI database.,"When training the four MOB classification models suitable for different length ranges, the training and testing sets were randomly split in a 7:3 ratio. There was no overlap between the training and testing sets; they were independent of each other.","When training plasmid DNA word vectors based on the Skip-gram language model, MOBFinder utilized a total of 37,139 plasmid genomes. For training the four MOB classification models, this study obtained the complete plasmid genomes from the NCBI database again and annotated them with MOB typing using the relaxase database. Subsequently, 67,925 plasmid genomes determined by MOB typing were used to simulate plasmid assembly fragments from metagenomic datasets for training the MOB classification models","The machine learning algorithms used in this study are the Skip-gram language model and Random Forest. Both of these methods are well-known in machine learning. Currently, methods used for MOB typing annotation rely on relaxase-based approaches such as MOB-suite and MOBscan. However, in metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments, relaxase sequences are often missing or incomplete. As a result, most plasmid assembly fragments are annotated as non-transferable plasmids. Due to differences in sequence features and host range among different MOB types, this study utilized the Skip-gram language model to digitally encode the biological patterns and features of metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments, resulting in significant performance improvements for MOBFinder. With a training dataset of up to 990,000 entries, Random Forest was used to prevent overfitting in training the MOB classification models. The combined use of these two algorithms effectively enhanced the performance of predicting MOB types in metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments. In some cases, F1 and AUC scores reached as high as 0.99, almost perfect.","According to our test results, MOBFinder takes approximately 5 to 18 minutes to predict on the test set, depending on the length and quantity of input data.","1. In word vector training, this study generated overlapping ""words"" of 4-mers from plasmid genomes and assigned a random numeric vector to each unique ""word"". These vectors were then inputted into a two-layer neural network for training, learning the probability of occurrence of 10 preceding and succeeding ""words"". The two-layer neural network consists of a hidden layer with 100 neurons. Finally, 100-dimensional word vectors corresponding to 256 DNA 4-mer ""words"" were outputted. 2. Training of the MOB classification model: This study utilized known relaxases of MOB types to perform MOB typing on plasmid genomes, selecting plasmid genomes with confirmed MOB types based on their scores to construct benchmark datasets. For each MOB type of plasmid genome, the training and testing sets were divided in a 7:3 ratio. The training set for each MOB type randomly generated 90,000 simulated metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments, while the testing set for each MOB type randomly generated 500 simulated metagenomic plasmid assembly fragments. All fragments were encoded using the generated 4-mer word vectors, with the average 100-dimensional word vector calculated as input for training the Random Forest model.","This tool did not conduct feature selection; instead, it used 100 word vector features trained by the skip-gram model as input.","The number of each MOB type in the training dataset is the same, and random forest was used to prevent overfitting.",,"1.
