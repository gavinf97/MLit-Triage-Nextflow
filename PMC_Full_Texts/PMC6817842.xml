Here we use biotinylated knockin alleles of seven key cardiac TFs (GATA4, NKX2-5, MEF2A, MEF2C, SRF, TBX5, TEAD1) to sensitively and reproducibly map their genome-wide occupancy in the fetal and adult mouse heart. These maps show that TF occupancy is dynamic between developmental stages and that multiple TFs often collaboratively occupy the same chromatin region through indirect cooperativity. Multi-TF regions exhibit features of functional regulatory elements, including evolutionary conservation, chromatin accessibility, and activity in transcriptional enhancer assays. H3K27ac, a feature of many enhancers, incompletely overlaps multi-TF regions, and multi-TF regions lacking H3K27ac retain conservation and enhancer activity. TEAD1 is a core component of the cardiac transcriptional network, co-occupying cardiac regulatory regions and controlling cardiomyocyte-specific gene functions. Our study provides a resource for deciphering the cardiac transcriptional regulatory network and gaining insights into the molecular mechanisms governing heart development.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Mapping transcription factors (TFs) occupancy is essential for understanding transcriptional programs.

We focused on regions distal (&#x0003e;2&#x02009;kb) to the TSS, to avoid potential effects of clustered TF binding near promoters. The inter-peak distance had a bimodal distribution (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), which was similar between intronic and intragenic locations (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">7a</xref>).

Cardiac TFs exhibited extensive collaborative binding, and detailed motif analysis suggests that collaborative binding is largely driven by indirect cooperativity. There were four TF pairs that did demonstrate preferred motif arrangements suggestive of cooperative binding through defined ternary complexes. Even in these cases, the preferred motif arrangement comprised a small fraction of all binding sites.

Each enhancer consisted of two 230&#x02009;bp ssDNA oligos with 20&#x02009;bp 3&#x02032; overlap. Each oligonucleotide&#x02019;s 5&#x02032; end had a 20&#x02009;bp primer-binding site. Oligonucleotides within the pool were annealed and 3&#x02032; ends were extended by PCR to create a library of 400&#x02009;bp enhancers flanked by 20&#x02009;bp priming sites. NotI/AscI-restriction sites were added to enhancers in a second round of PCR. The enhancer library was then digested, size selected, and ligated into the multiple cloning site of a self-complementary AAV plasmid containing a minimal MLC2v promoter-mCherry-NotI/AscI-polyA sequences. The ligation product was electroporated into Agilent SURE Electrocompetent cells following manufacturer recommendations, spread onto agar plates, and cultured overnight. Approximately 900,000 colonies were harvested and pooled for plasmid maxi-prep. The enhancer library was packaged into AAV as described above. P0 wildtype CFW mouse pups (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;28) were injected subcutaneously with 50&#x02009;&#x000b5;l saline containing containing 2E11 vg. Hearts were harvested at P7 and RNA was isolated from homogenized ventricular apexes via TRIzol phase extraction and reverse transcribed using a primer recognizing the start of the polyA sequence. NGS adapters and unique indexes were added to each sample in subsequent rounds of PCR amplification. Untransduced AAV DNA from the library pool was also prepared in the same fashion for sequencing in triplicate. Indexed samples were pooled and paired-end (2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;150&#x02009;bp) sequenced on a NextSeq500. After removal of adapters, reads were aligned to the mouse genome, keeping only mates that produced concordant alignments between 395 and 405&#x02009;bp. On average, each sample contained ~5M alignments passing these criteria. The number of reads for each enhancer in each sample was determined using BedTools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. The average number of reads for each enhancer within the untransduced AAV DNA was then calculated, and enhancers present at low frequencies (&#x0003c;5 RPM) were excluded. The majority (&#x0003e;90%) of enhancers were successfully created and were detected above the 5 RPM threshold. Read numbers for RNA samples were acquired using the same method. RNA:DNA ratio for each region was calculated and used as a readout of enhancer activity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Tissue harvest and chromatin precipitation</title><p id="Par50">Tissues were harvested in ice cold 1% formaldehyde/PBS from embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) and adult (P42) transgenic animals for all chromatin immunoprecipitations.
