Most bacterial genome sequences in the public archives exist in draft form with many contigs, making it difficult to determine if a contig is of chromosomal or plasmid origin. Using a training set of contigs comprising 10,584 chromosomes and 10,654 plasmids from the PATRIC database, we evaluated several machine learning models including random forest, logistic regression, XGBoost, and a neural network for their ability to classify chromosomal and plasmid sequences using nucleotide k-mers as features. Based on the methods tested, a neural network model that used nucleotide 6-mers as features that was trained on randomly selected chromosomal and plasmid subsequences 5kb in length achieved the best performance, outperforming existing out-of-the-box methods, with an average accuracy of 89.38% &#x000b1; 2.16% over a 10-fold cross validation. The model accuracy can be improved to 92.08% by using a voting strategy when classifying holdout sequences. In both plasmids and chromosomes, subsequences encoding functions involved in horizontal gene transfer&#x02014;including hypothetical proteins, transporters, phage, mobile elements, and CRISPR elements&#x02014;were most likely to be misclassified by the model. This study provides a straightforward approach for identifying plasmid-encoding sequences in short read assemblies without the need for sequence alignment-based tools.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

Plasmids often carry various genes conferring host virulence and antimicrobial resistance [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Bacteria can exchange genetic information using a plasmid as a &#x0201c;vehicle&#x0201d; through inter-host conjugation [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], which is one of the most effective mechanisms for driving evolution and adaptation [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. For example, a plasmid carrying a carbapenemase gene can be transferred to a susceptible <italic toggle="yes">Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (KPN) isolate, rendering it resistant to carbapenems [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Some virulence islands carried on plasmids can enhance the pathogenicity of a recipient bacterium and accelerate adverse clinical outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, accurate plasmid identification is pivotal for fully understanding gene flow in diverse environments, particularly in clinical settings.</p><p>Traditionally, plasmids were isolated from bacterial cultures using alkaline lysis and then sequenced to get their genetic information. However, these methods of identification are laborious and work best on smaller plasmids. Although culture-dependent methods have traditionally been used to isolate plasmids, including Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE), these methods are difficult to perform in high throughput [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Metagenomic sequencing methods can overcome limitations of traditional methods that require culturing or plasmid isolation [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; however, these methods often produce numerous contigs which require additional bioinformatic analyses to determine if they are from plasmids or chromosomes [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Many bioinformatic tools have been developed to identify plasmid sequences from the assembled genome sequences of pure isolates or metagenomic samples. Most of them are based on BLAST searches [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] against well-curated plasmid sequence databases such as PlasmidFinder or PLASDB [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. PlasmidFinder is a user-friendly, web-based program that aims to identify plasmid replicons in bacterial genome sequences [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. PLASDB is a resource containing over 34,000 plasmid records collected from the NCBI nucleotide database and provides users with an interactive view of all obtained plasmids with additional metadata such as sequence characteristics, sample-related information, and taxonomy [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although these tools are highly accurate, their accuracy is scoped to the sequence diversity within their respective database. For instance, PlasmidFinder was established for <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> detection and typing of plasmids for members of the <italic toggle="yes">Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, and PLSDB was built on bacterial plasmids retrieved from the NCBI nucleotide database.</p><p>Another promising approach to differentiating plasmid and chromosomal contigs is the use of machine learning (ML) techniques [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. ML models can potentially learn unique sequence features that differentiate plasmids and chromosomes, and recently, several studies that use ML models to distinguish plasmid and chromosome sequences have been published [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For example, PlasFlow employs a neural network for identifying bacterial plasmid sequences in environmental samples and achieved accuracies of up to 96%. PlasClass uses a logistic regression model that utilizes k-mer frequencies of plasmid and chromosomal subsequences with lengths up to 100kb. It achieved an accuracy of 96.9% with 100kb-length fragments. Another published tool called Mlplasmids uses 5-mer frequencies and a support-vector-machine based model to predict plasmid and chromosomal contigs from <italic toggle="yes">Enterococcus faecium</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Although the use of ML is showing considerable promise in the classification of plasmid and chromosomal sequences, more work is required to understand how the accuracy is affected by the choice of ML algorithms, sequence lengths, k-mer frequencies, and mobile genetic sequences within each element. In this study, we address these questions by building ML models and evaluating their ability to discriminate plasmids from chromosomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Datasets and feature extraction</title><p>Plasmid and chromosome sequences were retrieved from the PAThosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC) database (now called the Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatic Resource Center, BV-BRC) [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

Additionally, taxonomic information was also downloaded for each sequence used.

Although previous studies have shown that longer sequences tend to produce models with higher accuracy [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], we wanted to have the ability to classify shorter sequences without losing the ability to classify contigs of a reasonable length. For this reason, we chose to sample 2kb and 5kb subsequences from each chromosome and plasmid contig to generate the training set. This process was replicated 10 times to obtain 10 sequences from each chromosome and plasmid (<bold><xref rid="pone.0279280.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref></bold>).</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0279280.g002"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0279280.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Workflow for the study.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0279280.g002" position="float"/></fig><p>Nucleotide k-mer counts of either 6-mers or 9-mers were then computed for each subsequence using KMC3 [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Shorter k-mers, tend to capture nucleotide composition patterns such as G+C content and codon usage, while longer k-mers tend to capture unique sequence strings. We chose to evaluate 6-mers and 9-mers based on their overall memory footprint on our available GPUs (<bold>Supplemental Methods, S1 Fig in <xref rid="pone.0279280.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref></bold>). For each k-mer, the forward and reverse strands are considered, and only the lexicographically highest &#x0201c;canonical&#x0201d; k-mer is used in the models. In other words, to avoid double counting, the k-mer &#x0201c;AAAAAA&#x0201d; is counted rather than &#x0201c;TTTTTT&#x0201d; because either strand could have been sequenced. When the 5kb samples were used to build models, all plasmid contigs less than 5kb in length were excluded from the analysis. The dataset (exempting the holdout set) was split by 7:2:1 ratio for model training, testing, and validation, respectively.</p><p>ML models were built and tested using Python version 3.8. We computed logistic regression and random forest models using Scikit-Learn (version 0.21.3) [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], XGBoost models using XGBoost [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and a neural network using TensorFlow 2.0 [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We defined a binary classification problem using the category &#x0201c;plasmid&#x0201d; as positive class and &#x0201c;chromosome&#x0201d; as the negative class. For the logistic regression model, we tuned the following hyperparameters: penalty (&#x0201c;l1&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;l2&#x0201d;), C value (0.2 to 3 with step size of 0.2) and solver (&#x0201c;sag&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;liblinear&#x0201d;). We chose the following parameters: a penalty of 12, liblinear solver, and 1,000 maximum iterations to train the final logistic regression model because it resulted in the best accuracy. For the random forest model, we tuned the following hyperparameters: n_estimators (20 to 400 with step size of 20), max_depth (default, 10 to 100 with step size of 10), and criterion (&#x0201c;gini&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;entropy&#x0201d;) to evaluate the performance of the model each iteration under these parameters and to plot the results as learning curves. In the final random forest model, the number of trees in the forest was set as 200 and the remaining parameters were set as the defaults. For the XGBoost model, a grid search was designed to determine the best parameters for eta (0 to 1 with a step size of 0.05), max_depth (5 to 50 with a step size of 2), and objective (&#x0201c;binary:logistic,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;binary:hinge&#x0201d;). For the final XGBoost parameters, &#x0201c;objective&#x0201d; was set to &#x0201c;binary: logistic&#x0201d;, eta was set to 0.1, and the remaining parameters were set to the defaults. We tested a fully connected network from TensorFlow 2.0. The k-mer frequency matrix was scaled using StandardScaler in the sklearn package before input to the neural network models. The fully connected neural network in TensorFlow 2.0 was set to 7 layers which contained 256, 256, 128, 128, 32, 10, and 1 hidden neuron. A sigmoid activation function was chosen for the output layer while the remaining layers using a rectified linear unit activation function. Dropout layers were applied to the first 4 layers with dropout rates of 0.4, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.2, respectively. Besides the dropout layers, L2 weight regularization with value of 0.0001 was applied in the first four layers to reduce model overfitting. The model was fed by batch inputs with a batch size of 256 and trained for 200 epochs. Model hyperparameters were tuned using validation data. When we increased or decreased the number of fully connected layers and dropout layers, the model performance on the testing data set improved little. Also, few effects occurred when we adjusted the dropout rate.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>10-fold cross-validation</title><p>Ten-fold cross validations were performed to assess the accuracy of each model and its sensitivity to the input training set. The dataset (excluding the holdout data) was divided into 10 equal parts: one part was used for testing, one part for validation, and the remaining eight parts for training. In the ten rounds, every part appears in the training, testing and validation dataset, and bias was observed by tracking the average accuracy over the test set (<bold><xref rid="pone.0279280.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref></bold>).

Both of the models perform best for fragments greater than 10kb, but are also compatible with 5-kb fragments classification. We assessed these tools using the test data in the 10-fold cross-validation. Models were compared using the accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall. PlasFlow predictions contain three classes: plasmid, chromosome, and unclassified. Plasflow was evaluated omitting the samples with &#x0201c;unclassified&#x0201d; predictions.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Analysis of misclassified subsequences</title><p>The tuned neural network model was applied to 5kb subsequences drawn from the hold-out dataset containing 1,000 chromosomes and 1,000 plasmids. We sampled 5kb subsequences from the entire length of each contig. For each chromosomal contig, we sampled fragments in order using a window of 1kb as a buffer between each sampled fragment. We subsampled each plasmid into 5kb sequence fragments without using a gap since the plasmids tend to be smaller in size.

The viral and phage sequences were evaluated against the 5kb model, and the IS elements were evaluated against the 2kb model since most ISs have length less than 5kb. After omitting viral and phage sequences with lengths less than 5kb, we randomly selected 10 fragments from each viral genome and one fragment from each phage genome. For ISs, we omitted sequences with length less than 2,000 bp and then randomly selected 3 fragments with length of 2kb from each IS. The selected fragments were then processed using KMC3 to get 6-mer frequencies and fed into the model to get predictions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec010"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Model performance using different methods</title><p>We started by building random forest and logistic regression models for classifying plasmid and chromosomal contig sequences. These were chosen because they are common ML methods that have been used for similar classification problems [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and usually train rapidly. Since the plasmid and chromosomal contigs differ in their lengths, we randomly subsampled each contig into either 2kb or 5kb subsequences, choosing one subsequence per contig to train the models. We also tested k-mer lengths of 6 and 9 nucleotides. These k-mer lengths were chosen for evaluation because the shorter k-mers tend to capture nucleotide composition, while the longer k-mers capture specific sequence signatures. In order to provide the best performances, parameters were tuned for each model as described in the Materials and Methods.</p><p>Overall, the random forest and logistic regression models had similar accuracies in test datasets from the 10-fold cross-validation (<bold><xref rid="pone.0279280.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). The models trained on 2kb fragments had accuracies that were approximately 5% lower than the models trained on 5kb fragments. For instance, the random forest 6-mer model had an average accuracy of 72.86% &#x000b1; 2.54% using 2kb sequence fragments versus 78.13% &#x000b1; 2.12% using 5kb sequence fragments (data are shown as average the accuracy &#x000b1; standard deviation over 10-folds). Likewise, for logistic regression, the average 6-mer model accuracy over ten folds was 74.02% &#x000b1; 2.67% for the 2kb fragment model versus 78.79% &#x000b1; 1.95% for the 5kb fragment model.

To see how these other elements would be classified, we collected 6,682 viral genomes from RefSeq [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], 1,959 phage genomes from ENA [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and 5,889 ISs from the ISfinder database [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Each element was subdivided into 5kb sequence fragments and classified. Overall, the model assigned 41.5% of the viral sequence fragments to the plasmid class and 58.5% into the chromosomal class; 82.4% of phage sequence fragments into the chromosomal class, and 17.6% into the plasmid class; and 41.5% of the IS elements into the chromosomal class, and 58.5% into the plasmid class. In the case of viruses and IS elements, the classifications split relatively evenly over the plasmid and chromosomal classes, but the phage sequences are much more likely to be classified as being chromosomal. This may be due to a higher proportion of prophage elements in the chromosomal contigs of the training set. Overall, this suggests that developing and optimizing models that can properly capture these other sequence elements may help to improve the classification of plasmid and chromosomal contigs.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Comparison to other methods</title><p>Two methods, PlasClass [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and PlasFlow [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], use similar ML approaches to build classifiers to predict the plasmid or chromosomal origin of contig sequences. Using the same testing data sets in the 10-fold cross-validation, we classified 5kb sequence fragments using the PlasClass and PlasFlow models and compared their results with the accuracies of the models described above (<bold><xref rid="pone.0279280.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref></bold>). Overall, PlasFlow achieved an accuracy of 71.43% &#x000b1; 4.37% over the data set, and PlasClass achieved an accuracy of 78.10% &#x000b1; 3.28%. Interestingly, PlasFlow had a very high recall 90.98% &#x000b1; 2.45%, indicating that it had a low false negative rate, perhaps due to it being trained with a third "unclassified" class. Although both methods perform well out of the box and have results that are consistent with the other ML methods that were evaluated, the neural network models from this study appear to have slightly better performance, although we note that the training sets and sequence lengths differed for our models and the published PlasClass and PlasFlow models. Overall, the results indicate that the neural network approach developed in this study is an effective strategy for classifying chromosomes and plasmids.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0279280.t004"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0279280.t004</object-id><label>Table 4</label><caption><title>Comparison of the performance of PlasFlow and PlasClass with the models built in this study for the same test dataset in the 10-fold cross validation<xref rid="t004fn001" ref-type="table-fn">*</xref>.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0279280.t004" id="pone.0279280.t004g" position="float"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Method</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Accuracy (%)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">F1 score (%)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Recall (%)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Precision (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PlasClass</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">78.10 &#x000b1; 3.28</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">82.65 &#x000b1; 4.61</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">79.75 &#x000b1; 3.26</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">85.77 &#x000b1; 3.87</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PlasFlow</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71.43 &#x000b1; 4.37</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">81.34 &#x000b1; 5.66</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">90.98 &#x000b1; 2.45</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">73.55 &#x000b1; 5.25</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Random forest</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">83.98 &#x000b1; 2.03</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">84.25 &#x000b1; 2.67</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">84.36 &#x000b1; 3.06</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">84.14 &#x000b1; 1.66</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Logistic regression</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">83.17 &#x000b1; 2.26</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">83.75 &#x000b1; 2,71</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">81.65 &#x000b1; 2.22</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">85.96 &#x000b1; 2,30</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">XGBoost</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">79.59 &#x000b1; 2.43</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">80.70 &#x000b1; 1.75</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">80.05 &#x000b1; 2.57</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">81.38 &#x000b1; 2.11</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Neural network</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">89.38 &#x000b1; 2.16</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">89.67 &#x000b1; 2.14</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">87.28 &#x000b1; 2.03</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">87.42 &#x000b1; 0.92</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Neural network with best of three voting</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">92.08 &#x000b1; 1.93</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">92.23 &#x000b1; 2.19</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">91.98 &#x000b1; 1.87</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">92.48&#x000b1; 3.56</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t004fn001"><p>*Results are reported as the average accuracy for the test set using a 10-fold cross-validation with the standard deviation.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Discussion</title><p>Short-read next generation sequencing technologies have been the workhorse of genome sequencing for nearly twenty years, but short read assemblies are often difficult to close [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Because of this, most genomes are submitted to the public archives in draft form, which usually means that they exist in many contigs. In these data sets, unless there are long stretches of contiguity, it can be difficult to determine which contigs come from chromosomes and which come from plasmids. The problem is even worse in shotgun metagenomics, where the contigs are often from a mixture of organisms. In bacteria, genetic information usually passes vertically from parent to offspring during chromosomal replication. However, some traits including antimicrobial resistance and virulence can be encoded on plasmids, which are transmitted horizontally between recipient cells [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Thus, accurately identifying plasmid sequences and the genes that they encode is crucial for understanding bacterial epidemiology.</p><p>In this study, we explored various ML methods and parameters for classifying plasmid and chromosomal sequences. Although building a classifier based on two classes is straightforward, there are challenges in the experimental design. For example, since plasmids tend to be short, and chromosomes tend to be long, a simple strategy of computing k-mer counts or frequencies over the entire length of each contig tends to create imbalanced feature sets. To overcome this, we built classifiers by randomly sampling subsequences from each contig that were matched in length, either 2kb or 5kb. Unsurprisingly, we found that models built from 5kb fragments performed slightly better, which is likely due to the additional information encoded in the longer sequences. Likewise, we found that sampling each contig multiple times also improved the classification accuracy. Although using sequence fragments longer than 5kb may further improve the classification accuracy, we did not want to lose the ability to classify short contigs. It may be possible to achieve further gains in accuracy in future work by building ensembles of models that are tailored for various sequence lengths.</p><p>Our best model, which was based on a neural network using 6-mers as features and drawn from randomly sampled 5-kb subsequences from each contig, achieved an average accuracy of 92.08% &#x000b1; 2.16% when we used a &#x0201c;best out of three&#x0201d; voting strategy for classifying each contig in the test set. This model achieved higher accuracies than the published PlasClass and PlasFlow models for 5-kb fragment classification [<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0279280.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], which use similar ML approaches. However, this difference is likely overstated, since retraining the PlasClass and PlasFlow models on the same data set could potentially improve their performance. Nevertheless, the neural network strategy described in this study was robust to cross validation, sequence sampling, and taxonomic diversity. Using this as a starting point, we anticipate that it may be possible to further optimize model performances with more advanced parameter tuning, sequence sampling strategies, feature sets, and hardware.</p><p>Another challenge in classifying plasmid and chromosomal sequences is the natural genetic exchange that occurs between the replicons. When we examined the incorrectly classified subsequences from each class, we found a considerable overlap in their protein annotations. These included hallmarks of horizontal gene transfer including genes encoding transporters, phage proteins, and transposases. Furthermore, when we classified viral, phage and IS elements, we found that phage have a propensity to be classified in the chromosome class, which is likely due to the presence of prophage elements integrated in the chromosomes. Future work that explores the categorization of these elements into separate classes, or that includes functional annotations, may lead to overall improvements in the models.</p><p>In conclusion, after evaluating several strategies for building ML models to classify plasmid and chromosomal sequences, we found that the neural network model that used a voting strategy yields the best accuracy relative to other methods. This method outperformed existing methods out-of-the-box, using smaller training sequence lengths. This study provides a framework for identifying and characterizing plasmid DNA in NGS data sets with important human health implications.</p></sec><sec id="sec016" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0279280.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Supporting information&#x02013;contains the supporting methods, tables, and figure.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0279280.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the BV-BRC team for their helpful support.
