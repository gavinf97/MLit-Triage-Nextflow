Disturbances in splicing due to mutation lead to dysregulated protein expression and contribute to a substantial fraction of human disease. Several classes of splicing modulator compounds (SMCs) have been recently identified and establish that pre-mRNA splicing represents a target for therapy. We describe herein the identification of BPN-15477, a SMC that restores correct splicing of <italic>ELP1</italic> exon 20. Using transcriptome sequencing from treated fibroblast cells and a machine learning approach, we identify BPN-15477 responsive sequence signatures. We then leverage this model to discover 155 human disease genes harboring ClinVar mutations predicted to alter pre-mRNA splicing as targets for BPN-15477. Splicing assays confirm successful correction of splicing defects caused by mutations in <italic>CFTR</italic>, <italic>LIPA</italic>, <italic>MLH1</italic> and <italic>MAPT</italic>. Subsequent validations in two disease-relevant cellular models demonstrate that BPN-15477 increases functional protein, confirming the clinical potential of our predictions.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Drugs that modify RNA splicing are promising treatments for many genetic diseases.

Differential processing of pre-mRNA is one of the principal mechanisms generating diversity in different cell and tissue types. This process can give rise to functionally different proteins and can also generate mRNAs with different localization, stability, and efficiency of translation through alternative splicing of UTRs. RNA splicing requires the widely conserved spliceosome machinery along with multiple splicing factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The splicing reaction is directed by specific sequences, including the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; splice sites, the intron branch point, and splice site enhancers and silencers found in both exons and introns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Changes in the sequence of these elements, through inherited or sporadic mutations, can result in deficient or aberrant splice site recognition by the spliceosome. Disruption of splicing regulatory elements can generate aberrant transcripts through complete or partial exon skipping, intron inclusion or mis-regulation of alternative splicing, while mutations in the UTRs may affect transcript localization, stability, or efficiency of translation. Mutations that alter mRNA splicing are known to lead to many human monogenic diseases including spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), cystic fibrosis (CF), familial dysautonomia (FD), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), and myotonic dystrophy (DM), as well as contribute to complex diseases such as cancer and diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The emergence of high throughput sequencing of large disease cohorts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, and the remarkable efforts to aggregate and annotate these mutations in an accessible infrastructure such as ClinVar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, now provides an unprecedented opportunity to apply deep learning approaches to predict mutations that affect pre-mRNA splicing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The potential of developing such models will continue to increase as next-generation transcriptome sequencing (RNASeq) data are amassed and curation of the associated mutational processes matures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Therapeutic approaches aimed at correction of pre-mRNA splicing defects, including antisense oligonucleotides, splicing modulator compounds (SMCs), and modified exon-specific U1 small nuclear RNA, have shown significant promise in many diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. SMCs are attractive because they can be optimized for broad tissue distribution and are orally administered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. With advances in precision medicine and the capability to discover patient-specific mutations, there is strong impetus to develop methods to predict if a drug might be beneficial in a specific patient. Deep learning techniques offer the potential to accomplish this at scale by integrating genomic data with annotation databases and relevant information about mutational mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Deep learning models have been successfully applied to a spectrum of biological topics, including genotype-phenotype correlation studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, identification of disease biomarkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, and identification of protein binding motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Here, we applied and optimized a specific deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to discover motifs that are likely to be responsive to BPN-15477, a potent SMC of the <italic>ELP1</italic> pre-mRNA carrying the major FD splice mutation IVS20&#x02009;+&#x02009;6T&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;C. We identified 155 genes harboring pathogenic ClinVar mutations, each predicted to disrupt pre-mRNA splicing, that could be corrected by BPN-15477 treatment, and validated several using minigenes or patient cells. These studies suggest that the integration of genomic information, clinical annotation of disease-associated variants, and deep learning techniques have significant potential to predict therapeutic targeting for precision medicine.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Discovery of the splicing modulator BPN-15477</title><p id="Par5">Several small-molecules have been developed to selectively modulate the splicing of specific pre-mRNAs, offering potential treatments for SMA and FD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. One such compound, kinetin (6-furfurylaminopurine), was previously shown to promote exon 20 inclusion in the Elongator complex protein 1 gene (ELP1, MIM: 603722) in FD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Although kinetin is a naturally occurring compound with a safe absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) profile, very high doses are necessary to achieve modest <italic>ELP1</italic> splicing correction in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. As part of the NIH Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network, we identified a class of highly potent SMCs that selectively modulate <italic>ELP1</italic> pre-mRNA splicing and increase the inclusion of exon 20<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. BPN-15477 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) increases full-length <italic>ELP1</italic> mRNA by increasing exon 20 inclusion and is significantly more potent and efficacious than kinetin in our luciferase splicing assay (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b,c</xref>)&#x000a0;and&#x000a0; in FD patient cell lines (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Previously, we showed that a modest increase in ELP1 protein rescued neurologic phenotypes in a phenotypic mouse model of FD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Therefore, we evaluated BPN-15477 in vivo to confirm that splicing correction can lead to a concomitant increase in ELP1 protein. We treated the <italic>TgFD9</italic> transgenic mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, which carries the human <italic>ELP1</italic> gene with the major FD splice mutation, once daily via oral gavage for 7 days, and mice were sacrificed 1&#x02009;h after the last dose. Treatment increased full-length <italic>ELP1</italic> transcript in a dose-dependent manner and, importantly, led to at least a two-fold increase in functional ELP1 protein in brain, liver, kidney, heart, and skin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e, f</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a&#x02013;c</xref>). In addition, the treatment was well tolerated, no weight loss or adverse effects were observed in the treated groups, and the level of splicing correction correlated with BPN-15477 tissue distribution (Supplementary Fig. 1d&#x02013;e). These results clearly demonstrate that treatment with BPN-15477, which corrects splicing of the <italic>ELP1</italic> transcript, significantly increases the level of functional protein in vivo in all tissues, including brain.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Identification of the small molecule splicing modulator BPN-15477.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Molecular structure of BPN-15477 compared to kinetin, the northern heterocycle and C-2 substitution are indicated in red. <bold>b</bold> Schematic representation of the dual-reporter minigene used to measure splicing.

These sequences govern interaction with the spliceosome and splicing factors and regulate the fate of exon recognition and inclusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that sequence signatures within the exon triplets are a key determinant of drug responsiveness. To identify the sequence motifs, we trained a CNN model using the inclusion-response set (254 exon triplets), exclusion-response set (680 exon triplets), and the unchanged-response set (382 exon triplets with two expressed isoforms, &#x00394;<italic>&#x003c8;</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01 and FDR&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;0.1, Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). We randomly divided these sequences into three non-overlapping groups, namely the training set (70%), the validation set (20%), and the test set (10%, see &#x0201c;Methods&#x0201d;). The network consisted of two layers of convolutions with a total of 2.5 million trainable parameters (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>) and was optimized for predicting splicing changes in every given exon triplet after BPN-15477 treatment. Our model achieved an average area-under-the curve (AUC) of 0.85 (Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b&#x02013;c</xref>). To evaluate the reproducibility of our model, we first implemented random initialization of our training process 1000 times and found that the performance of all models was tightly distributed and aligned with our original model (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2d</xref>). In addition, we found all of the top 10 first-layer filters contributing to the performance of our CNN model were highly correlated with those of the 1000 random-initialized models (average Pearson correlation <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.55, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2e</xref>), suggesting that our deep learning framework was robust. We identified 39 5-mer motifs from the first layer of the CNN model that best explain drug responsiveness (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Note, the treatment response was not determined by any of these motifs independently. Instead, the CNN model utilized the synergistic effect of all the motifs on a given sequence to make the classification decision. Thirteen of these motifs explained 92.62% of the AUC, each of which altered more than 0.05 of AUC for at least one class of prediction (see &#x0201c;Methods&#x0201d;, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Importantly, analysis of these motifs revealed that the sequence in proximity to, and in many cases encompassing, the 5&#x02032; splice site of the middle exon had the largest influence in modulating treatment response (see &#x0201c;Methods&#x0201d;, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). These results emphasized the importance of the 5&#x02032; splice site in determining treatment outcome. In silico saturation mutagenesis (see &#x0201c;Methods&#x0201d;) further supported these findings, revealing that base contribution to the treatment outcomes peaked around the 5&#x02032; splice sites of the middle exons, with distinct patterns amongst sequences with inclusion, exclusion and unchanged responses (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). To assess the robustness of the motifs identified by our CNN model, we compared the similarities of the 13 CNN-identified motifs with the most enriched five-nucleotide combinations (5-mer) at 5&#x02032; splice sites of the middle exons in our training set. The 5-mer sequence enrichment analysis for nucleotides at positions &#x02212;3 to +7 of 5&#x02032; splice sites was highly correlated with motifs identified by the CNN model (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5a</xref>). We and others previously reported that SMCs with chemical structures similar to BPN-15477 promote, either directly or indirectly, the recruitment of U1 snRNP, to non-canonical 5&#x02032; splice sites, which have weak splice site strength scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Therefore, we evaluated splice site strength using MaxEntScan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> and found that the 5&#x02032; splice site of the middle exon is significantly weaker when exon inclusion is enhanced by treatment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>).

Our CNN model predicted that the mutated sequence would be responsive to BPN-15477 and the treatment would promote exon 10 exclusion, thereby potentially restoring 3R/4R balance (Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). We generated HEK293 cells stably expressing a <italic>MAPT</italic> minigene encompassing exons 9&#x02013;11 and partial introns 9 and 10 with both the wild type sequence and the c.1866&#x02009;+&#x02009;3G&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;A mutation. As predicted, treatment with BPN-15477 led to a significant reduction of exon 10 inclusion in the wild-type MAPT transcript. Unfortunately, introduction of the c.1866&#x02009;+&#x02009;3G&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;A mutation in the minigene context completely disrupted exon 10 skipping in both the DMSO and BPN-15477 treated minigenes (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5c</xref>).

Further, in vivo splicing correction of <italic>ELP1</italic> in a humanized transgenic mouse model leads to an increase of ELP1 protein in all tissues, including brain, at a level that would be therapeutic since we have previously shown that even a small increase in functional protein has a dramatic effect on neurologic disease phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par17">To determine the potential of the tool compound BPN-15477 to correct splicing of other genes, we developed a machine learning approach that uses sequence signatures to predict targetable splicing defects. Our CNN model identified a total of 39 5-mer motifs important for drug response, with 13 motifs accounting for most of the BPN-15477 sensitivity when motifs are located close to the 5&#x02032; splice site. Note, our model achieved an acceptable performance level (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b</xref>) with a training set of ~1000 non-redundant events, which is a relatively small size for a typical deep learning problem. This might be due to the following two reasons. First, we observed that the trained model scored highly with a short region of ~8&#x02009;bp (out of a 400&#x02009;bp training region) flanking the 5&#x02032; ss of the middle exon, while the scores of other regions were almost zero (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). This suggests the effect site of the treatment might be in a restricted region relative to 5&#x02032; ss, and we might be able to train a simplified model on shorter sequences with fewer parameters. Second, we empirically avoided overfitting by applying the L1-regularization (coefficient&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.6) in the convolutional layers and the dropout strategy (see &#x0201c;Methods&#x0201d;) in the hidden layer during model training.

Application of our CNN model to all ClinVar pathogenic mutations that disrupt splicing identified 214 human disease-causing mutations in 155 unique genes as potential therapeutic targets of BPN-15477, proving that deep learning models are a powerful approach to explore therapeutic targets for drugs that modify RNA splicing.</p><p id="Par20">As proof of principle, we validated the treatment effect on splicing for several disease-causing mutations using patient cell lines or minigenes, and demonstrate the potential therapeutic feasibility of targeting splicing in patients with cystic fibrosis (<italic>CFTR</italic>), cholesterol ester storage disease (<italic>LIPA</italic>), Lynch syndrome (<italic>MLH1</italic>), and familial frontotemporal dementia (<italic>MAPT</italic>).

From a therapeutic perspective, restoring the 3R/4R tau ratio has the potential to reduce or even eliminate unbound 4R tau. Our results further suggest that an optimized form of this SMC might be beneficial for other forms of FTD caused by gain of function mutations in exon 10, such as P301L, P301S, or the S305N, since treatment could reduce the level of mutated transcript.</p><p id="Par22">To our knowledge, this work represents the first application of a machine learning approach to analyze the global activity of a splicing modifier compound and identify therapeutic targets.

The first round of convolution is applied with fifty 4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;5 weight matrices, converting the input matrix into a 50&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;396 convoluted matrix, in which each row represents the convolution of one weight matrix. Then the convoluted matrix is nonlinearly transformed by rectified linear unit (ReLU) function and max pool stage takes the maximum of two adjacent positions of each row, shrinking the output matrix to a size of 50&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;198. Then the second round of convolution applies fifty 4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 weight matrices, followed by the same ReLU transformation and max pool of the first round. The output is converted to 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;500 matrix to initiate the hidden layer, where a fully connected network is built with 90% dropout rate. The output from the hidden layer is ReLU transformed again and is then linearly transformed into a vector of three values, representing three different treatment responses. The final sigmoid nonlinearity maps each element in the vector to a value between 0 and 1, considering the probability of drug responsiveness. In each epoch of training, average of area-under-curve (AUC) was measured on the validation set across the prediction of three treatment responses. The training and validation loss in terms of binary cross-entropy were measured on the training set and validation set, respectively. The training process stopped if there is no improvement of the average of AUC in 10 consecutive epochs. In this study, we stopped at 12th epoch to avoid overfitting (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Evaluation model performance transcriptome-wide</title><p id="Par51">To examine the model performance on human transcriptome, all exon triplets whose PSI was between 0.01 and 0.99 either before or after treatment were recruited. The &#x0201c;true inclusion responding&#x0201d; group was defined triplets with PSI changes &#x02265;0.01 after treatment while the &#x0201c;true exclusion responding&#x0201d; group was defined as triplets with PSI changes &#x02264;&#x02212;0.01 after treatment. The remaining ones were considered as &#x0201c;true unchanged&#x0201d; group. The CNN model was then applied on these triplets and ROC-AUC and PR-AUC were calculated respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Random initialization</title><p id="Par52">The initial parameters were generated from the random selection of 1000 different seeds. Each set of these initial parameter sets was used to train a CNN model of the same structure. The training, validation, and test rules were the same as our original model. By doing so, 1000 random CNN models were trained together with the original one in this study. For each model, AUC for each class was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Examination of motif contribution</title><p id="Par53">To examine motif contribution in classification, the test set was used as model input. For each motif&#x02019;s contribution to be measured, its total output of the first convolutional layer was manually set to zero, mimicking the situation where that motif had not been found. The model was then taken forward without tuning other parameters and the new AUC of each class was calculated. The contribution of that motif was measured as the difference between the new AUC and the original AUC of each class. All motifs were investigated in this way in turn. A motif whose contribution is more than 0 in any class is considered a true identified motif. A motif whose contribution is no less than 0.05 in any class is considered a top contributor in drug response prediction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Analysis of positional importance</title><p id="Par54">To examine each motif contribution in classification, the test set was used as model input. We directly investigate the positional activation of the first layer of each motif. For each motif, we averaged the first layer activation of the same position across all sequences. Then we transformed the positional average activations of each motif to their z-scores.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>In silico saturation mutagenesis</title><p id="Par55">For a given input sequence, each position was mutated in silico to the other three alternative nucleotides. The loss of the model using mutated sequences was calculated and compared to the loss derived from the original sequence. The maximum change to the loss at each position was recorded. Nucleotides were drawn proportionally to the change of loss, beyond a minimum height of 0.25.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Standardized probability from prediction</title><p id="Par56">To determine the final drug response (inclusion, exclusion, or unchanged) from the prediction, the raw prediction score from the model was standardized. For each class, a cutoff representing 95% specificity of that class was identified on the validation set. The intermediate score of each class was calculated as the raw prediction score divided by the cutoff of that class. The standardized probability for each class was then calculated as the intermediate score divided by the sum of intermediate scores of three classes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title><italic>k-</italic>mer enrichment analysis</title><p id="Par57">The sequences at &#x02212;3 to +7&#x02009;bp of the 5&#x02032; splice sites of the middle exons for inclusion, exclusion, and unchanged exon triplets were extracted.
