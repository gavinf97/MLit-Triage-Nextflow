While the main enzymes that facilitate this process have been identified, global maps of RNA turnover are available for only a few species.

We quantified the abundance of each position in the transcriptome as a function of time using RNA-sequencing data and later analyzed the global mRNA decay map using machine learning principles. Half-lives, calculated on a per-ORF (open reading frame) basis, were extremely short, with a median half-life of only 0.97 min. Despite extremely rapid turnover of most mRNA, transcripts encoding proteins involved in photosynthesis were both highly expressed and highly stable. Upon inspection of these stable transcripts, we identified an enriched motif in the 3&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR) that had similarity to Rho-independent terminators. We built statistical models for half-life prediction and used them to systematically identify sequence motifs in both 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; UTRs that correlate with stabilized transcripts. We found that transcripts linked to a terminator containing a poly(U) tract had a longer half-life than both those without a poly(U) tract and those without a terminator.</p><p><bold>IMPORTANCE</bold> RNA degradation is an important process that affects the final concentration of individual mRNAs, affecting protein expression and cellular physiology.

In bacteria, the abundance of a given RNA transcript, and ultimately any protein it encodes, is controlled by the balance of nascent transcription and RNA degradation. A suite of enzymes called RNases facilitate the bulk of RNA turnover. Although many RNases have been characterized, there is limited information on their precise <italic>in vivo</italic> sequence targets and how enzymes contribute to the turnover of individual mRNA. While general mechanistic models of global RNA turnover have been described and debated (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), tools capable of predicting the stability of a given RNA remain elusive. This is in part because the relationship between sequence elements, secondary structures, and other biophysical information on the rate of RNA decay remain poorly understood. The first step toward closing this knowledge gap is collecting global decay rates across the transcriptome of various species.</p><p>In prokaryotes, transcripts are quickly turned over, allowing for rapid response to environmental change via conditional transcription (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Using antibiotics to stop transcription, global turnover rates have been quantified in many species via bulk RNA measurements, microarrays, and more recently RNA-sequencing data. Transcript half-lives are often on the order of minutes: <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content>, 2.8 min, 4.7 min, and 6.8 min (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>); <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacillus subtilis</named-content>, 5 min (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>); <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bacillus cereus</named-content>, 2.4 min (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>); <named-content content-type="genus-species">Lactococcus lactis</named-content>, 5.8 min (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>); <named-content content-type="genus-species">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</named-content>, 9.5 min (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>); and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Chlamydia trachomatis</named-content> trachoma, 15 to 17 min (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Short turnover times are logical for fast-growing species, but rapid turnover has also been observed in a slow-growing cyanobacterium, <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> strain MED4, where the median half-life was 2.4 min despite doubling only once or twice per day (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we examined RNA degradation in another cyanobacterium, <italic>Synechococcus</italic> sp. strain PCC 7002 (PCC 7002), which is among the fastest-growing photoautotrophs (doubling time &#x0223c;2.5&#x02009;h) (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). PCC 7002 is also genetically tractable with a wide suite of synthetic biology tools (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), making it attractive for fundamental studies and use for green chemical production from CO<sub>2</sub> and sunlight (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Another reason motivating the study of RNA degradation in PCC 7002 is its unique array of RNases that facilitate both RNA maturation and degradation. The functions of three homologs of RNase III have been studied (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), but PCC 7002 also has both an essential homolog of RNase E (a hallmark of RNA degradation in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content>) and an essential homolog of RNase J (a hallmark of RNA degradation in <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. subtilis</named-content>) (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The impact of the presence of both essential enzymes on RNA turnover remains unexplained. As a first step toward establishing a turnover model, we used RNA-sequencing to quantify global RNA levels in PCC 7002 after the arrest of transcription. We calculated global RNA half-lives on a per-ORF (open reading frame) basis and examined how transcript half-life was related to cellular function and what sequence features correlated with enhanced transcript stability. From this analysis, we observed that transcripts encoding proteins involved in photosynthesis were disproportionately stable, perhaps contributing to their large steady-state abundance. Using machine learning and motif identification algorithms, we identified a conserved sequence motif similar to Rho-independent terminators in the 3&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR) of these stable transcripts. These findings may guide the design of future heterologous transcripts and facilitate the development of global RNA turnover models.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><p>We collected total RNA samples from three biological replicates of PCC 7002 before (0 min) and 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 min after rifampin addition. We added synthetic RNA spike-ins to cell pellets immediately before lysis to normalize for potential large differences in mRNA pool sizes. We isolated total RNA and reduced the rRNA content with commercial reagents. We used this pool of enriched mRNA to prepare a library for sequencing via Illumina HiSeq. The number of reads that aligned to the RNA spike-ins was counted and found to linearly correlate with RNA copy number (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1</xref> in the supplemental material). After aligning each read to the PCC 7002 genome, the abundance of each position was normalized to the number of RNA spike-ins in the sample and averaged over each predicted ORF. We then fitted the normalized abundance to an exponential decay model and calculated the half-life of each ORF&#x02019;s transcript. We were able to calculate transcript half-life values for 2,949 ORFs (91.1%) which had a median half-life of 0.97 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). The average half-life was 1.18 min with a standard deviation of 0.73 min. We classified 0.5% of the transcripts as stable because each had greater than 50% of the original read counts in the final time point (<italic>t</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10 min). We could not calculate half-lives for 4.4% of transcripts because of null or low expression and for another 4.1% that exhibited a poor fit to the exponential model. For transcripts containing operons, we observed an increase in half-life along the length of the transcript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig.&#x000a0;S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">S3</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Global mRNA decay trends for PCC 7002.

We looked for motifs in both the upstream region (150&#x02009;bp), an approximation of the 5&#x02032; UTR, and downstream region (100&#x02009;bp), an approximation of the 3&#x02032; UTR, of each ORF that were enriched when linked to transcripts with long half-lives. Using MEME (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) in discriminative mode, we looked for motifs overrepresented in the sequences surrounding the 400 most stable transcripts compared to the control 400 least stable transcripts. No significant motifs were identified in the upstream region, but an enriched motif was found in the downstream region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4B</xref>). This 21-base motif had an E value of 5.6e<sup>&#x02212;083</sup> and featured a prominent string of six consecutive U&#x02019;s. This motif is reminiscent of Rho-independent terminators, which feature a G-C-rich hairpin followed by a U-rich tract. Therefore, we asked whether the presence of a terminator in the 3&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR) was predictive of stability of other transcripts. To examine whether different putative terminator forms are significantly associated with transcript stability, we used the Web Genome Scanner for Terminators (WebGeSTer) database (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). We divided transcripts into three classes based on the absence of a known terminator motif, presence of an L-shaped terminator (hairpin with a U-tract), or the presence of an I-shaped terminator (hairpin without a U-tract). We found that transcripts linked to an L-shaped terminator containing a U-tract in the 3&#x02032; UTR had a significantly longer half-life (<italic>P&#x02009;=&#x02009;</italic>4.8&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;13</sup> [L versus I] and <italic>P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;</italic>2.0&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup> [L versus none]) than transcripts that contained an I-shaped terminator in the 3&#x02032; UTR or no obvious Rho-independent terminator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4D</xref>).

Model-predicted half-life values for different transcripts in PCC 7002 correlated very well with experimentally measured half-lives (Spearman rank coefficient of 0.88 under 10-fold cross validation [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.&#x000a0;5A</xref>]). The feature importance scores revealed a set of putative sequence motifs in the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; UTRs that correlate with transcript stability and therefore could be used to enhance the stability of a heterologous transcript. Consistent with the prior MEME search, most of the motifs are present in the 3&#x02032; UTR and contain a poly(U) trail which could be involved in Rho-independent termination. A few motifs in the 5&#x02032; UTR were detected (e.g., ACTACCTG, TAAGGAAT, AAAACTT, TCGAAAAC, and AACTCTAA). In addition to enhancing the stability of mRNA transcripts, these sequence motifs might be involved in enhancing translation initiation (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Although one of the motifs has a purine-rich signal (AGGA) that resembles the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence, it is well known that SD-like sequences found in the leaders of many mRNAs from cyanobacteria are hypervariable in base composition, size, and location compared to those in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>Machine learning-based identification of sequence motifs in UTR.

Only 15 transcripts were classified as stable (retaining at least 50% of the read counts from the initial pre-rifampin time point). Prior experiments using RNA sequencing to study RNA degradation (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) have shown that mRNA half-lives are much shorter than original values determined by microarrays (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Even so, RNA degradation occurred more rapidly in PCC 7002 than expected.</p><p>We examined if any groups of transcripts that encode different cellular functions had significantly longer half-lives and found both that photosynthesis genes were highly expressed and that their transcripts were highly stable. Moreover, the biophysical feature-based analysis indicated expression level to be one of the top predictors of mRNA half-life (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig.&#x000a0;S3</xref> in the supplemental material). The abundance of mRNA-encoding photosynthesis genes and all genes falling under the energy metabolism category is not by itself surprising, as these proteins perform essential functions in the cell. There are only 53 genes categorized as photosynthesis genes, of which the mRNA half-life values could be determined for 38 and 2 were categorized as stable. Many of these 40 transcripts are both highly abundant and very stable, making it hard to differentiate between whether being inherently stable increases expression level and/or having high expression protects the transcript from degradation.</p><p>Nevertheless, we wanted to identify sequence elements that may be predictive of increased transcript stability; to precisely control RNA transcript stability, these elements may be helpful to guide the construction of heterologous transcripts. To this end, we identified an enriched motif in the 3&#x02032; UTR of stable transcripts that consisted of a string of U&#x02019;s. Upon further characterization, putative upstream hairpins were also identified, which suggests that this motif is reminiscent of canonical Rho-independent terminators that consist of a G-C-rich hairpin followed by a U-tract. Indeed, the location of these motifs had very significant overlap with computationally predicted Rho-independent terminators (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). We then explored whether putative terminator forms may be associated with transcript stability. Early algorithms designed to identify intrinsic terminators searched for the canonical sequence motifs that are typically found in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> intrinsic termination: the GC palindrome and the poly(U) tract. Surprisingly, in many organisms no terminators were found, and it was suggested that they relied on some yet-uncharacterized termination mechanism (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). More recent algorithms designed to address this issue found that many of these organisms contain hairpin structures but lack the canonical U-tract and were thus overlooked (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Terminators have been classified into several groups with the major one being L-shaped (hairpin and U-tract) and I-shaped (hairpin with no U-tract). We found that transcripts with L-shaped terminators had a significantly longer half-life than those with an I-shaped terminator or no predicted terminator in the 3&#x02032; UTR, which strongly suggests that terminator form is predictive of transcript stability in PCC 7002. That said, initial attempts to stabilize heterologous transcripts with sequences pulled from the stable cassettes failed.</p><p>The observation that an L-shaped terminator may be associated with stable transcripts in PCC 7002, but not an I-shaped terminator, indicates that the U-tract itself may play an important function in contributing to transcript stability. This could be a direct effect through the affinity and activity of exoribonucleases on a terminal U-tract or could be indirect, causing a difference in termination efficiency. It has been suggested that the U-tract serves as a pausing signal (possibly through backtracking) that facilitates the folding of the hairpin, irreversibly trapping the RNA polymerase complex and disrupting all key contacts between RNA, DNA, and RNA polymerase (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). It is possible that the presence or absence of the U-tract determines termination efficiency and the presence or absence of the poly-U&#x02019;s at the end of a transcript influences transcript stability. The distinction between different Rho-independent termination structures could be quite important in cyanobacteria because without a known homolog of Rho (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), intrinsic termination is likely the dominant termination method. However, the precise reason for this association with stable transcripts remains unknown and could be, likely, coupled to the specific RNA transcript sequences upstream or downstream of the putative L-form terminators. This is especially true as many transcripts with putative L-form terminators have comparable or lower stability than transcripts without this putative terminator form. Moreover, around one-fourth of the genes in the energy metabolism group, as well as the subcategory photosynthesis genes, have L-shaped terminators (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS5">Fig.&#x000a0;S5</xref>), indicating the role of a gene and the presence of an L-shaped terminator to be jointly affecting the stability of a gene.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="figS5"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1128/mSystems.00224-20.5</object-id><label>FIG&#x000a0;S5</label><p>Role of a gene and occurrence of L-shaped terminators.

The impact of both the hairpin and U-tract on transcript stability of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content>
<italic>crp</italic> transcript was analyzed, and the removal of the of the G-C hairpin enhanced transcript degradation, but disruption of the U-tract did not affect transcript stability. Additionally, swapping the terminator for other native Rho-independent terminators did not change expression level or transcript stability (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). However, as <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> was the model organism tested in this study, it is reasonable to speculate that RNAs may be processed differently in cyanobacteria, especially given a different repertoire of RNases (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Indeed, the presence of RNA hairpins at the 3&#x02032; end of transcripts may act as a barrier to exonuclease degradation, as several 3&#x02032;-to-5&#x02032; exonucleases cannot degrade secondary structure (RNase II) or require a toehold such as polyadenylation to initiate degradation (RNase R and PNPase) (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether RNases act differently on L- or I-form terminators and, thus, influence transcript stability in a noncanonical 3&#x02032;-to-5&#x02032; direction.</p><p>Machine learning-based statistical models were built to systematically explore the role of different sequence- and structure-based properties of mRNA in the stability of a transcript. Analyzing the regression coefficients in this model revealed that the normalized expression level of a transcript, its position within the operon, and the ribosome binding site (RBS) strength as predicted by the RBS calculator (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) were three of the most influential factors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig.&#x000a0;S3</xref>). The effects of expression level and position within an operon have already been discussed in the preceding paragraphs. A plausible reason for observing RBS strength as one of the top three influential factors is that the genes that are being actively translated might be less susceptible to the nuclease activity.</p><p>Several aspects of this data collection and workflow were fundamental to obtaining high-quality half-lives for most of the PCC 7002 transcriptome. The short time frame of sampling was extremely important for capturing rapidly decaying messages. Most studies of RNA degradation have taken an initial time point and then not collected the next samples until 2.5 or 5 min after addition of rifampin. In all of these studies, the overall median or average half-life is likely skewed as much of the early mRNA degradation may have been missed. A study in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> that included an 0.5-min time point also found an extremely low median half-life of 2.8 min in exponential phase and 5.4 min in stationary phase (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Another critical aspect of this data set is the use of RNA spike-ins (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The typical RNA-sequencing pipeline normalizes to the total number of reads from each sample, which can greatly distort the results when the pool size of mRNA is shrinking throughout the time course. RNA spike-ins can be added proportionally to the number of cells to normalize both for the change in RNA pool size between samples and for variation between samples introduced during library preparation. The need for RNA spike-ins to correct for differences in RNA or DNA yields from samples has been addressed previously (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), but their use has still been quite limited. A standardized set of spike-ins has been developed for eukaryotes (the External RNA Controls Consortium [ERCC] mix of 96 polyadenylated transcripts), but there is no standardized set for use in prokaryotes. We hope that RNA spike-ins become standard for future RNA degradation studies and that the methods described in this work and reference <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> will enable robust measurements of RNA half-lives in other prokaryotes.</p><p>This data set can also be probed to ask other fundamental questions about RNA degradation such as the potential directionality of transcript degradation. Early <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> measurements using microarrays suggested that degradation occurs in a 5&#x02032;-to-3&#x02032; direction by analyzing operons containing 2 or more ORFs (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Similar findings were found in the slow-growing cyanobacterium <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> MED4, where stability correlated with distance from the transcription start site (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). This 5&#x02032;-to-3&#x02032; directionality was also observed within monocistronic transcripts. In <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. cereus</named-content>, researchers observed a mix of 5&#x02032;-to-3&#x02032; degradation, 3&#x02032;-to-5&#x02032; degradation, and more complex patterns (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Here, we also observed a 5&#x02032;-to-3&#x02032; directionality of degradation where the half-life increased with distance along an operon (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig.&#x000a0;S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">S3</xref>). The 5&#x02032;-to-3&#x02032; directionality may be caused by strong RNase J (5&#x02032;-to-3&#x02032; exonuclease) activity or RNase E processively cleaving transcripts in this direction.</p><p>Alternatively, the observed 5&#x02032;-to-3&#x02032; directionality may be caused by the use of rifampin to stop transcription. Rifampin binds the &#x003b2; subunit of RNA polymerase and blocks the channel for the elongating RNA (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). This blockage prevents extension of the RNA beyond 2 or 3 nucleotides but has no effect on elongating RNA polymerases. Researchers have noticed a delay before transcripts begin to decay for locations downstream of the transcription start site (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). They showed that this delay disappeared when streptolydigin (an antibiotic that prevents transcription elongation) was used in place of rifampin. The change in this delay due to residual transcription was used to calculate the elongation rate, 25 nucleotides per second on average. The effect of residual transcription after rifampin addition was estimated to be less than 30&#x02009;s for <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).</p><p>Despite these drawbacks, rifampin has been used in all RNA-sequencing and microarray studies to examine global transcript degradation. This is due to rifampin availability and cost. The confounding influence on half-life calculations may be minimal when initial time points are not taken until 2.5 or 5 min after rifampin addition, but it may significantly influence half-lives when samples are taken early. This effect would be even more exaggerated with greater global transcription elongation rates. There is little known about cyanobacterial transcription rates, but <italic>in vitro</italic> data comparing RNA polymerase from <italic>Synechococcus</italic> sp. strain PCC 7942 and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Thermosynechococcus elongatus</named-content> BP-1 with that from <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> showed that the cyanobacterial enzymes took six times longer to complete the same transcript (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Additionally, there were significant differences in levels of abortive transcription and misincorporation. The global differences in transcriptional machinery and transcription rates must also be considered when comparing global degradation rates between organisms. We hypothesize that the 5&#x02032;-to-3&#x02032; directionality we see in degradation in this cyanobacterial data set may be entirely due to the use of rifampin and residual transcription.</p><p>The conditions during sampling may have a large impact on RNA half-life. These cyanobacterial RNA half-lives were determined at an optical density (OD<sub>730</sub>) of &#x0223c;0.2, which is between late exponential and early linear phase for the environmental conditions used. We chose this growth phase because we wanted to examine actively growing and dividing cells. This could be why we saw high stability and abundance of mRNA encoded by photosynthesis genes. In this time period, cells were growing rapidly and needed to produce high levels of photosynthesis machinery. Transcript degradation, however, is likely influenced by many factors including growth phase, growth rate, and environmental changes. There is an increasing body of evidence that RNase activity and expression can be influenced by inhibitors (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), temperature (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), growth phase (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), and osmolarity (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). The findings described here are from one experimental condition and would likely be different under other conditions. To gain a better understanding of global RNA degradation, it will be necessary to examine global decay rates under many different conditions and to identify which specific RNases are affected under these conditions. Ultimately, a global understanding of transcript degradation would enable accurate predictions of transcript half-life given its sequence, but currently there is a lack of knowledge of how transcript stability is regulated and how different sequence elements impact RNA processing and degradation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4.1"><title>Sampling.</title><p>Wild-type <italic>Synechococcus</italic> sp.

Cultures were bubbled with air and grown with continuous illumination for 22&#x02009;h to reach an OD<sub>730</sub> of &#x0223c;0.2 before sampling.</p><p>Two milliliters of each culture was collected for cell counts via hemocytometer and OD<sub>730</sub> measurements. Forty milliliters of culture was collected, deposited into a 50-ml conical tube containing 5.0&#x02009;ml stop solution (10% phenol in ethanol), and placed on ice. Rifampin was added at a concentration of 200&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml (in dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]), and samples were taken as described above at 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 min following addition.

The supernatant was carefully aspirated to prevent loss of cells, and samples were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until RNA extraction (&#x0223c;1&#x02009;week).</p><p>Processes regulated by circadian rhythms or light-dark cycles could have significant and important influences on gene expression levels and decay rates in addition to overall cellular physiology. To avoid complexity introduced by these variables, continuous illumination was used for precultures and experimental growth conditions. Several tradeoffs were considered during experimental design. First, because light shading in optically dense cultures attenuates growth, we chose to use rapidly growing dilute cultures at late exponential/early linear growth phase (OD<sub>730</sub> of &#x0223c;0.2). Thus, dilute cultures were harvested via centrifugation. There was some flotation of the cultures which led to pelleting on the side of the vial, but since they were centrifuged in 50-ml vials, the supernatant could be carefully aspirated without disruption or loss of the pellet. Careful harvesting and extraction are crucial aspects of these experiments, and extra care was taken at each step. It is possible that residual RNase activity could affect the measurements. Therefore, we used a quench solution and rapid cooling to prevent residual activity, which would be much more likely before hot-phenol extraction. In addition, we added RNA spike-ins at the extraction step to account for residual RNase activity. The decay curves were fitted to an exponential decay model, and multiple replicates were used to compare samples and provide statistical support to the overall findings.

Conventionally, a random forest approach builds an ensemble model by combining decision trees built on bootstrap sampled data sets as well as using a random subset of features to identify the best candidate feature for splitting at each node (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). This randomization helps increase the variability among the individual decision trees built and also helps speed up the process of model building as one does not have to analyze the complete set of features (&#x0223c;200,000 features for UTR sequence motif analysis). The extremely randomized trees approach uses an additional layer of randomization by randomly choosing thresholds at each node rather than computing the most discriminative threshold at each step. This helps reduce the variance component of error for the ensemble model built by averaging the predictions across individual trees at the cost of a minor increase in bias.</p><p>The optimal values for hyperparameters, max_features (number of features to consider when looking for best split expressed in terms of fraction) and min_samples_split (the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node), were found to be 0.5 and 100 based on a grid search over the range [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9] and [2, 5, 10, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1,000], respectively, under 10-fold cross-validation. Number of estimators was set to 100 decision trees.</p><p>The feature importance scores were computed based on mean decrease in impurity measures, and the distribution of sequence motif in training set was used to determine whether a particular motif is stabilizing or destabilizing in nature. In general, the features that show up at the top of a decision tree are considered more important as they contribute to predictive decision of a larger fraction of samples. The importance of a node in a decision tree can be determined by computing the decrease in impurity metric for the node weighted by the fraction of samples arriving at that node (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS6">Fig.&#x000a0;S6</xref>). Feature importance scores can then be computed by averaging the node importance scores pertaining to the feature and then averaging it across all trees in the forest. For regression setting, the impurity metric is computed based on decrease in mean squared error (or variance), while for classification setting, the impurity metric is computed based on the Gini index which is defined as follows:<disp-formula id="uFD1"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="mSystems.00224-20-m0001.jpg" position="float" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="um1"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Gini index</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:munderover><mml:mstyle mathsize="140%" displaystyle="true"><mml:mo>&#x02211;</mml:mo></mml:mstyle><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:munderover><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></disp-formula>where <italic>j</italic> is the node index, <italic>i</italic> is the label index, <italic>c</italic> denotes the cardinality of classes, and <italic>f</italic> is the fraction of samples belonging to class <italic>i</italic>.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="figS6"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1128/mSystems.00224-20.6</object-id><label>FIG&#x000a0;S6</label><p>Feature importance computation using impurity measures.
