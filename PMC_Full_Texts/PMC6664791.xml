They have been found to play important roles in viral infection, cellular apoptosis, cellular differentiation and response to external stimuli such as hypoxia, serum deprivation and heat shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. IRES have been identified as potential therapeutic targets for antagonists that can interrupt IRES function and control the expression of viral proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Such drugs could be small-molecule inhibitors such as peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), small interfering RNAs, antisense oligonucleotides, and ribozymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. An improved understanding of cellular IRES function under different physiological conditions will increase our understanding of the response of cells in proliferation, apoptosis and tumorigenesis.</p><p id="Par10">IRES are widely found in both viral and cellular mRNA. They were first discovered in the Poliovirus (PV) and Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) RNA genomes in 1988 using a synthetic bicistronic assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The assay places potential IRES sequence segments between two reporter genes, and measures the expression of the reporter genes in comparison to a non-IRES control construct. The bicistronic assay is considered to be the best experimental method to confirm the presence of IRES. However, this method is time consuming and labor intensive, and in the past 30&#x02009;years, only a few hundred IRES have been confirmed. The difficulty of identifying IRES is complicated by our incomplete understanding of the mechanism(s) of IRES function. In the simplest case, that of Dicistroviruses such as cricket paralysis virus (CrPV), IRES function without the help of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) or IRES trans-acting factors (ITAFs), but in other viruses, and in most cellular IRES, eIFs and ITAFs are required. Various lines of evidence implicate RNA structure in IRES function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], especially in IRES that do not require additional protein factors, but the relative importance of RNA structure, ITAFs, and (possibly unidentified) RNA binding proteins remains unclear. Whether all IRES share a common mechanism, and therefore common sequence and structural features, has not been determined, and universal features shared by all IRES have yet to be identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This substantial gap in our knowledge can be largely attributed to the relatively small number of confirmed IRES, which has made identification of common features difficult.</p><p id="Par11">It has been estimated that about 10% of cellular and viral mRNA may use IRES to initiate translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], but the limited number of confirmed IRES has prevented study and understanding of IRES function. Alternative approaches to IRES identification, such as comparative analysis of IRES primary/secondary/tertiary structure, have been tried, but little commonality has been found across all IRES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Small sequence motifs have been reported to be conserved within specific viral IRES groups, for instance, a GNRA sequence is shared in picornavirus IRES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The SL2.1 stem/loop contains a U rich motif that has been found to be important for ribosome binding in the Dicistrovirus intergenic region (IGR) IRES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">The absence of universally conserved features across all IRES makes their prediction difficult from a bioinformatics perspective, but several systems have been implemented. For example, the Viral IRES Prediction System (VIPS) predicts the secondary structure of an RNA from its sequence, and uses the RNA Align program to align the predicted structure to known IRES to predict whether the sequence contains an IRES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, VIPS predictions are limited to viral IRES, and although the accuracy rate of VIPS was assessed as over 80% for four viral IRES sub-groups, the prediction accuracy was assessed only on the training dataset and is substantially overestimated. The ability of VIPS to find novel viral IRES is low in our hands (note that the VIPS server is no longer available). A more recent method, IRESPred, uses 35 sequence and structural features and the probabilities of interactions between RNA and small subunit ribosomal proteins to predict IRES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. IRESpred was trained using a non-IRES negative training set that included viral protein coding and cellular protein coding mRNA sequences; unfortunately some of these sequences were later found to contain IRES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In addition, IRESpred incorporates features such as UTR length and the number of upstream AUGs. Such features are dependent on the length of the query sequence, and most of the positive training set is substantially longer than the negative training set. The overall false positive rate for IRES prediction with IRESPred is high: in a test of 100 random 400 base sequences, 98 were predicted to be IRES (results not shown). This high false positive rate has been confirmed by other investigators, as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Instead of using features common to all IRES to determine for prediction, recent results suggest that machine learning approaches that combine multiple weak learners to predict IRES may be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In 2016, Weingarten-Gabbay et al. developed a high-throughput IRES activity assay and employed it to identify thousands of novel IRES in human and viral genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The identification of many new IRES improves the likelihood that a machine learning model can be successfully implemented. Based on the Weingarten-Gabbay et al. dataset, Gritsenko et al. built a stochastic gradient-boosting decision tree model (GBDT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] to predict IRES using 6120 kmer features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, the large feature set leads to possible model overfitting and slow model fitting time.</p><p id="Par14">IRESfinder, the most recent method, uses only the human genome part of the Weingarten-Gabbay et al. dataset and implements a logit model with framed kmer features to predict cellular IRES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The IRESfinder logit model was trained only on cellular IRES, and, as a transformed linear model, may not work well for non-linear relationships. In addition, the independent testing dataset is very small (only 13 sequences), possibly leading to overestimation of the AUC.</p><p id="Par15">In this manuscript, we describe a machine learning model that combines sequence and structural features to predict both viral and cellular IRES, with better performance than previous models. In order to make the predictive model widely available, it has been implemented as a simple to execute R/Shiny app. The optimized model, IRESpy, is very fast, and can be used to make genome scale predictions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><p id="Par16">In a typical scenario, one has only the sequence of the RNA available and does not have additional information (such as experimentally determined secondary and tertiary structure). In this work, we focus on features that can be obtained from the sequence alone, rather than on comparative information, which requires a curated comparative database. We consider three kinds of features: sequence features, structural features, and sequence-structural hybrid features.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sequence features</title><p id="Par17">Sequence features are the tabulated frequencies of kmer words in the target sequences. Given the four base RNA alphabets, there are 4<sup><italic>k</italic></sup> words of length <italic>k</italic>, yielding four 1mer, sixteen 2mer, sixty-four 3mer, and two hundred and fifty-six 4mer features (total&#x02009;=&#x02009;340). It is possible that sequence features, which might correspond to protein binding sites, could be localized with respect to other features in the IRES. To incorporate this possibility, we consider both global kmers, the word frequency counted over the entire length of the sequence, and local kmers, which are counted in 20 base windows with a 10-base overlap, beginning at the 5&#x02032; end of the sequence of interest. In all cases, the kmer count is divided by the sequence length to give the kmer frequency. An example of kmer calculation for the Cricket Paralysis Virus intergenic region (CrPV IGR) IRES is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Calculation of Kmer features.

This is undesirable as could lead to false positive predictions based on the length of the query sequence. While this effect is reduced using Dataset 2, in which all training sequences are the same length, sequence length is clearly a conflating variable that should be excluded.</p><p id="Par19">Q<sub>MFE</sub>, the ratio of the PMFE and the PMFE of randomized sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], is much less dependent on sequence length (see <xref rid="Sec15" ref-type="sec">methods</xref>). It is believed that the stability of RNA secondary structure depends crucially on the stacking of adjacent base pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Therefore, the frequencies of dinucleotides in the randomized sequences are an important consideration in calculating the PMFE of randomized sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In calculating Q<sub>MFE</sub>, a dinucleotide preserving randomization method has been used to generate randomized sequences.</p><p id="Par20">Q<sub>MFE</sub> can be used to compare the degree of predicted secondary structure in different sequences regardless of length. This length independent statistic indicates whether the degree of secondary structure is relatively lower or higher than that of randomized sequences, respectively. Viral IRES have been found to have highly folded secondary structures that are critical for their function. The structures of Dicistrovirus IRES, in particular, are conserved and comprise folded structures with three pseudoknots. Cellular IRES typically need ITAFs to initiate translation, and the binding between ITAFs and cellular IRES has been proposed to activate the IRES structure by changing it from a relaxed status to a rigid status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Cellular IRES are therefore likely to have a less extensively base-paired secondary structure. The 5&#x02032; UTRs of housekeeping genes, in general, do not require highly folded structures because they use the cap-dependent translation initiation process.</p><p id="Par21">Average Q<sub>MFE</sub> values clearly differ in viral IRES, cellular IRES and the UTRs of housekeeping genes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). We expect that Q<sub>MFE</sub> also should be different in IRES and non-IRES regions of the same mRNA. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a shows the observed differences in Q<sub>MFE</sub> of selected viral IRES, cellular IRES, and a housekeeping gene 5&#x02019;UTR. The Q<sub>MFE</sub> of the viral IRES is the lowest, indicating the presence of a more stable folded structure. The cellular IRES Q<sub>MFE</sub> is about 0.5, which indicates this sequence has an intermediate degree of secondary structure, but still more than would be expected for randomized sequences, and the 5&#x02019;UTR of the ERH housekeeping genes has the highest Q<sub>MFE</sub>, indicating a relatively low degree of secondary structure. These results suggest that the Q<sub>MFE</sub> can indicate the degree of base-paired secondary structure in various sequence classes, and may be useful in distinguishing IRES and non-IRES sequences.

The first database, referred to as Dataset 1 in this work, comprises confirmed IRES drawn from IRESite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and includes selected 5&#x02019;UTRs of housekeeping genes. Fifty-two viral IRES and 64 cellular IRES from IRESite are labeled as IRES in Dataset 1.

This large increase in the number of examples of IRES provides an opportunity to better learn the relationship between sequence and structural features and IRES mechanism. We primarily rely on the Dataset 2 to build the machine learning model due to its large size and semi-quantitative measure of IRES activity.

To explore all other IRES from other species and with various lengths, and to provide an independent test set, Dataset 1 is used.</p><p id="Par25">Dataset 2 has been randomly divided into a training partition (90%) and a validation partition (10%). The training dataset was used in a grid search to optimize the XGBoost model parameter: learning rate, maximum tree depth, subsample ratio of the training instances, and subsample ratio of the features, used when constructing each tree (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3). Each combination of parameters was evaluated using 10-fold cross validation, in which the training partition is equally divided into 10 sets; one set is used for testing, and the remainder used for training in each run. In successive runs, different partitions are held out for testing. In the end, the best fit parameters are summarized to generate the final set of model parameters.

Successive trees that &#x0201c;correct&#x0201d; the errors in the initial tree are then learned to improve the classification of positive and negative training examples. Compared with gradient boosting, XGBoost can be more efficiently parallelized, and incorporates regularization and tree pruning to reduce over-fitting.

We hypothesized that Q<sub>MFE</sub>, and triplet features, because they are length independent and combine sequence and structural information, might act as better features to classify IRES and non-IRES sequences. In particular, triplet features have the potential to reveal locally conserved sequence motifs that appear in a specific structural context. These features have been combined with the previously examined global kmer features in a sequence-structural model that is better than the simple sequence-based model. The testing AUC of the combined model increases slightly, from 0.771 to 0.775 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The small magnitude of the increase probably indicates the presence of correlation between the global kmer and structural features. When using the structural features alone, the testing AUC is 0.741, which means that the structural features can still capture most of the variance of the dataset with only 33 features.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Effect of incorporating structural features.

Machine learning (ML) models are often considered &#x0201c;black boxes&#x0201d; due to their complex inner mechanism. Understanding the contribution of each feature to the model has been recognized as a very difficult aspect of machine learning. The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method assigns values that measure the marginal contribution of each feature to the model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It combines game theory with local explanations and is well suited for machine learning explanation. Unlike feature importance measures based on weight, cover, or information gain, the SHAP value is the only consistent and locally accurate additive method, and it can be interpreted as indicating which features are the most globally important for classification. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a shows the top 20 most important features in models trained with both global and local kmers. Red indicates higher feature values and blue indicates lower feature values. Higher frequencies of U rich kmers, such as &#x0201c;U&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;UU&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;UUU&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;UUUU&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;CU&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;UGU&#x0201d;, are associated with higher predicted probability of being IRES. This is consistent with the previous reports that pyrimidine-rich kmers, especially U rich kmers are important for IRES function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Importance of global kmer and local kmer features follow similar patterns, for instance, the local kmer features U_121, U_131, U_141, U_151, and U_161 all support classification of sequences as IRES, as do the global kmer features. The importance of the local region from base 121&#x02013;161 may be important as an ITAF binding site (perhaps pyrimidine tract binding protein), as suggested by Weingarten-Gabbay et al. Whether the CU feature is related to the poly U feature is difficult to tell. It is worth noting that in picornaviral IRES, one of the most conserved features is the SL3A &#x0201c;hexaloop&#x0201d; in which a CU dinucleotide is highly conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b lists the SHAP values of the top important features for the global kmer only model.

The assumption of LIME is that every complex model has a linear or explainable relationship in the local space of the dataset. It is possible to fit a simple model around a sequence by slightly permuting its feature matrix. In LIME, a similarity matrix that measures the distance between a query sequence and a certain number of permutations is constructed. Each permutation is classified by the XGBoost model, and the predicted class, IRES or non-IRES, is classified by a simple model. The simple model uses the same features as the XGBoost model, and mimics how the XGBoost model behaves in the local space defined by the permutations.

In particular, the triplet &#x0201c;U &#x02026;&#x0201d;, a loop with a central U base, can be seen to be important. This feature may correspond to the conserved U rich loop motif found in the SL2.1 region of Dicistrovirus IGR IRES.

The cells were sorted with FACS and assigned to 16 fluorescence intensity bins on the basis of eGFP expression. IRES activity, in the range 206 to 50000, is defined by those expression levels. The correlation between the IRES probability predicted by our XGBoost model and the quantitative IRES experimental activities has been explored, and the result shows that the predicted IRES probability is significantly higher for high-activity (&#x0003e;&#x02009;600) IRES, than for those where the IRES activity is close to the base level (&#x02264;600) in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>.

IRESpy clearly distinguishes IRES and non-IRES sequences in Dataset 1. The low predicted IRES probability for all highly structured RNA groups suggests that IRESpy is not simply detecting relatively structured RNA. Since a relatively high amount of secondary structure is widely considered to be a hallmark of IRES, the test against highly structured RNAS represents an especially difficult test (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>).<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption><p>Predicted probability of IRES for highly structured RNA families, and IRES and non-IRES classes in Datasets 1 and 2</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12859_2019_2999_Fig10_HTML" id="MO11"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par39">Clearly, both the selected features and the models are important for predicting the existence of IRES. A limitation of VIPS and IRESPred are the inclusion of length dependent features such as the length of UTRs, and the number of upstream AUGs. This is a serious drawback when predicting IRES in UTRs, which vary greatly in length. IRESpy performs better than the GBDT method, using a smaller number of features. Using the same datasets and features (global and local kmer features), but switching from the GBDT model to XGBoost, increases the validation AUC by 5%, and the decreases the training time by 75%.</p><p id="Par40">Global kmer and local kmer features are highly correlated. The XGBoost model achieves the same model performance as the GBDT model incorporating only global kmer features. The modest increase in classification performance, accompanied by a 94% decrease in the number of features, suggests that the IRESpy model shows better generalization. The reduced number of model features results in a decrease in both training time and classification time (making the XGBoost model more appropriate for genome wide scanning).</p><p id="Par41">Surprisingly, incorporation of structural features such as Q<sub>MFE</sub> and triplet features, has relatively little effect on model performance, although some of the highly ranked features such as &#x0201c;U &#x02026;&#x0201d; can be directly related to known mechanistic features of some IRES. The reason for this lack of improvement are not obvious. Several explanations seem possible. The extensive nature of the Q<sub>MFE</sub>, while it provides an overall measure of the degree of secondary structure, may not be sensitive enough to particular structural and topological features that are important to IRES function, i.e. a high degree of structure may not be sufficient &#x02013; specific structures may be required. This seems likely. Alternatively, while the prediction MFE RNA structures is relatively good, generally estimated to be about 80% accurate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] at the base pair level, it may not be good enough to reliably detect structural motifs. Furthermore, the RNA structure prediction approach used here does not predict pseudoknots which, based our knowledge of viral IRES, may be highly important to IRES function. On the other hand, triplet features take a very local view of structure and sequence, and may be too detailed to capture the important larger structural motifs. Another explanation may be that, in fact, IRES function involves many different mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] &#x02013; the XGBoost decision tree models can capture the fact that different features are important for different IRES, but unfortunately, teasing this information out of the trained model is difficult &#x02013; the interpretation of the importance of features in machine learning models is a topic of high interest in the machine learning community. The SHAP feature importance plots shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> can serve as a potential motif list for researchers to test in laboratory experiments. In particular, the triplet &#x0201c;U &#x02026;&#x0201d; may indicate the importance of a conserved U rich loop motif similar to that found in the SL2.1 region of the Dicistrovirus IGR IRES. The CU kmer is part of a known tetraloop motif (CUYG) which may be important in stabilizing the IRES structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The combination of global kmer features and structural features increases the validation AUC compared with that of the model incorporating global kmer features alone, but only modestly. Using structural features alone achieves relatively high classification performance, and at the same time, reduces the number of features from 340 to 33. From one point of view, this indicates that the structural features are relatively powerful, providing higher performance per feature, but why these features do not greatly increase predictive performance remains unclear.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par42">In summary, IRESpy is a high-throughput online tool for IRES prediction.
