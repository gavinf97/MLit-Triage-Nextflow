However, there exist few automatic methods to detect CHD at an early stage. A challenge in the development of these methods is the absence of relevant datasets for their training and validation. Here, the ten Tusscher-Panfilov 2006 model and the O&#x02019;Hara-Rudy model for human myocytes were used to create two populations of models that were in concordance with data obtained from healthy individuals (control populations) and included inter-subject variability. The effects of ischemia were subsequently included in the control populations to simulate the effects of mild and severe ischemic events on single cells, full ischemic cables of cells and cables of cells with various sizes of ischemic regions. Action potential and pseudo-ECG biomarkers were measured to assess how the evolution of ischemia could be quantified. Finally, two neural network classifiers were trained to identify the different degrees of ischemia using the pseudo-ECG biomarkers. The control populations showed action potential and pseudo-ECG biomarkers within the physiological ranges and the trends in the biomarkers commonly identified in ischemic patients were observed in the ischemic populations. On the one hand, inter-subject variability in the ischemic pseudo-ECGs precluded the detection and classification of early ischemic events using any single biomarker. On the other hand, the neural networks showed sensitivity and positive predictive value above 95%. Additionally, the neural networks revealed that the biomarkers that were relevant for the detection of ischemia were different from those relevant for its classification. This work showed that a computational approach could be used, when data is scarce, to validate proof-of-concept machine learning methods to detect ischemic events.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>H2020 Marie Sk&#x00142;odowska-Curie Actions ()</institution></funding-source><award-id>642612</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6298-7950</contrib-id><name><surname>Ledezma</surname><given-names>Carlos Alberto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Leverhulme Trust (GB)</institution></funding-source><award-id>RF-2015-482</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diaz-Zuccarini</surname><given-names>Vanessa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Wellcome Trust (GB)</institution></funding-source><award-id>Senior Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rodriguez</surname><given-names>Blanca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>H2020 research and innovation programme</institution></funding-source><award-id>675451</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>CL and VD received funding from the European Union&#x02019;s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 642612 under the VPH-CaSE ITN framework (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://vph-case.eu">http://vph-case.eu</ext-link>).

Even though sometimes CHD is asymptomatic, it is very likely to cause ischemia and infarction. Current clinical guidelines suggest to target personalized therapies to patients at high risk [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] to reduce the deaths by CHD, but there exist few automatic methods for individual risk assessment. Consequently, clinicians rely on visual ECG inspection, which has been proven to be affected by personal bias and fatigue [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Furthermore, inter-subject variability plays a defining role when assessing this risk: a healthy-looking patient can suddenly die of CHD and a patient considered at high risk can live many years without showing indications of the underlying pathology. Moreover, CHD often presents itself as a &#x02018;silent&#x02019; disease, showing no symptoms, and a heart attack or a stroke is the first warning [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Consequently, assessing the individual risk of suffering from coronary heart disease is today one of the most pressing issues in biomedical engineering.</p><p>The study of the effects of ischemia <italic>in-vivo</italic> in humans is often affected by many methodological factors [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and is limited by small cohorts of patients because of the invasiveness of the necessary acquisitions and scarcity of suitable individuals [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0220294.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Indeed, there are very few public electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings databases specifically acquired for the study of ischemia, and the few that exist contain a limiting number of caveats. For instance, the STAFFIII database [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], one of the most relevant ECG databases for the study of ischemia to date, contains just 104 patients, aged 60.77 &#x000b1; 11.57 years, with pre-existing cardiac conditions and varied morphological features (e.g. location of myocardial infarction or which artery was occluded); these factors, commonly found in clinical acquisitions concerning ischemia, compromise the clinical extrapolation of the findings of ischemia studies in humans [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Moreover, the lack of relevant datasets has precluded the development of machine learning methods for the detection of early-stage ischemic events because they fail to generalize. Indeed, machine learning techniques, in the context of ECG analysis, have mostly been developed for the detection of abnormal cardiac rhythms, as can be consulted in the recent review by Lyon et al. [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], or for the detection and localization of myocardial infarction, as has been summarized by Acharya et al. [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; to the best of our knowledge, there is no machine learning technique applied to the early detection of ischemia that has successfully generalized to clinical practice. However, previous research has already highlighted that computer simulations could be used to generate large datasets suitable for the training of machine learning algorithms [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This paper was motivated by the hypothesis that a computational study, <italic>prior</italic> to a clinical trial, could be beneficial to the development of ischemia-detection methods.</p><p>Recent studies have investigated the effects of ischemia through mathematical models of cardiac electrophysiology (EP) [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The introduction of ischemia in computational models has allowed the study of its effects in single cells, cables of cells, slabs of tissue and whole heart models. Some whole-heart <italic>in-silico</italic> studies have also calculated and analyzed ECG signals from ischemic hearts [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. An advantage of these computational studies, over their experimental counterparts, is that the severity and size of the ischemic event can be modulated in detail. Moreover, computational simplifications (i.e. 1D cable of cells or 2D slab of tissue instead of 3D heart geometry) already enable the study of pathological behavior [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0220294.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] without the need of extensive computational resources. However, hitherto, computational studies of ischemia have not included the inherent variability that is naturally observed in humans at the cellular electrophysiology level [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Including variability in mathematical models for ischemia could enable the creation of simulated databases that may be large enough for the training of machine learning algorithms.</p><p>To analyze the effects of inter-subject variability at the cellular level, recent research in cardiac EP has resorted to &#x02018;experimentally-calibrated population of models&#x02019; (ePoM). The ePoM approach has been successfully applied to investigate the effects of variability in the EP properties of myocytes, both in physiology and pathology [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Previous population-based studies have explored how EP properties are affected by ionic current variabilities during acute ischemia [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0220294.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], but population-based techniques are yet to be adapted to create populations of ischemic ECG signals that include inter-subject variability.</p><p>This work presents a methodology that intends to prove the feasibility of ischemia classification using machine learning techniques. Here, simulated data, constructed using an ePoM approach, is used to validate proof-of-concept classifiers as a step prior to training with clinical data; the motivation behind this is that a classifier that does not work on ideal data will be uncapable of generalizing to a real-life environment. Morevover, this work hypothesized that training on simulated data could highlight which ECG biomarkers provide more information about the presence of ischemia. Consequently, an initial computational study could be used to guide the complicated analysis of real ECG signals. Observe that this does not mean that the discoveries from the computational study would be directly translatable to a clinical setup. As with any <italic>in silico</italic> study, the insights found through this framework would then require clinical validation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Models of human cellular electrophysiology</title><p>In this work, cardiac EP was simulated with the two most widely used, state of the art, models. First, the ten Tusscher-Panfilov 2006 (TP06) model [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0220294.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] provided an efficient implementation, capable of reproducing the effects of ischemia. For the purpose of comparison, the O&#x02019;Hara-Rudy (ORd) model for the undiseased human cardiac ventricular action potential [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] was also used because it is the most detailed and thoroughly validated description of cardiac EP to date. However, since the ORd model is more complex and, consequently, computationally more expensive than the TP06, it was only used during the modeling part of this work and not for the machine learning section. The ORd model is not capable of reproducing conduction of action potentials (AP) under severe hyperkalemic conditions, so the equations for the <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Na</italic></sub>
<italic>h</italic> gates of the ORd model were modified as suggested by Passini et al. [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and the time constants of the <italic>h</italic> and <italic>j</italic> gates were modified as prescribed by Dutta et al. [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

First, as explained by Muszkiewicz at al. [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], all the maximal conductances and peak currents of the model in question were allowed to vary between 0 and 2 times their baseline value and 10000 different parameter combinations were selected using Latin Hypercube Sampling [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Then, using each parameter combination, a single cell simulation was performed at 430 ms and 600 ms cycle length (CL) to match the experimental calibration data. Each model was stimulated for 200 beats, needed to reach steady state conditions, and only the last beat was saved for further analysis. Once the 10000 simulations were completed, models were excluded from the study using the following criteria: action potential amplitude less than 0, resting membrane potential larger than -64 mV and upstroke time exceeding 10 ms.

First, the examples were randomly divided into a training set and an evaluation set, containing 75% and 25% of the data, respectively. The training set was then used to perform a 10-fold cross-validation. In each of the cross-validation iterations the weights of the ANN were initialized to random small values. Then, all the cross-validation training examples were propagated through the network and the cost was calculated using a binary cross-entropy function regularized using weight decay. The derivative of the cost with respect to each of the network&#x02019;s weights was calculated using back-propagation and the weights were updated following the gradient descent. The weights that performed best during the cross-validation were tested in the evaluation set, the performance on this set was the one reported in the results.

Two virtual databases, containing over 6000 models, were constructed by means of an experimentally-calibrated populations of models approach. The AP and pECG biomarkers measured from the models contained in the database were in concordance with various simulation and experimental data [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0220294.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive simulation database for the study of acute ischemia to date, it includes cellular-level variability and contains information about the presence of ischemia, its severity and its effect on the ECG. Second, this study has introduced the use of simulation data to validate proof-of-concept neural networks that could, with further research, inform subsequent clinical studies in the early detection of ischemic events using ECG biomarkers; this approach had been, to date, unexplored. The analysis of the neural networks highlighted the importance of using multiple biomarkers and complex features for the detection of ischemic events and shed light on which are those that should be monitored for early detection. The mathematical models and machine learning techniques developed throughout this study will enable further research in the detection and prevention of myocardial ischemia.</p><sec id="sec016"><title>ePoMs reproduce physiological variability under control and ischemic conditions</title><p>Two virtual databases were constructed using experimentally-calibrated populations of models, one using TP06 models and the other using ORd models. The results presented in the previous section indicate that the models contained in these databases reproduce the healthy behavior of cardiac myocytes and the evolution of an ischemic event within those individual models. Furthermore, the ePoM approach enabled the introduction of inter-subject variability in those virtual databases, thus making them closer to what would be found in a clinical study. The results also show that variability has an additive effect, i.e. a relatively small variability in AP biomarkers resulted in larger variability in pECG biomarkers.</p><p>
<xref rid="pone.0220294.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows that the AP biomarkers of the <italic>Control</italic> ePoMs were within the values expected in healthy cells. Additionally, the pECG biomarkers were consistent with those previously presented by Gima and Rudy [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Hence, it can be argued that both of the <italic>Control</italic> ePoMs were, indeed, a good representation of a healthy population. Furthermore, even though the populations were constrained to a specific range of APD90, the <italic>Control</italic> biomarkers (see <xref rid="pone.0220294.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) vary within individual models; this is the effect of including inter-subject variability.</p><p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220294.g002">Fig 2</xref> exemplifies how AP biomarkers were affected during ischemic events whilst still showing inter-subject variability. Namely, the impairment in <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>CaL</italic></sub> and introduction of hypoxic effects (through <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>k</italic>(<italic>ATP</italic>)</sub>) produced a clear reduction in action potential duration, the increase in extra-cellular potassium translated in an increase in RMP and the reduction of the <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Na</italic></sub> current caused a clear reduction in APA. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220294.g004">Fig 4</xref> shows that the variations from the <italic>Control</italic> values observed in the ischemic pECG biomarkers were similar to those described in clinical practice. Namely, the <italic>Mild</italic> and <italic>Severe</italic> ePoMs showed ST segment deviation [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0220294.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], reduction in QT interval [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0220294.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and T wave deformation [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The variability observed at the cellular level during the ischemic events was relatively small, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220294.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows little overlap in the values of APD90 and RMP. However, the additive effect of variability can be clearly observed in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220294.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220294.g004">4</xref>, where there is a larger overlap in the values of conduction velocity and pECG biomarkers.</p><p>These results are consistent with previous pECG studies [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0220294.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0220294.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0220294.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and with well-known effects of ischemia on humans [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. So it can be argued that the variability contained in the ePoMs is a faithful representation of the actual variability observed in humans. One of the key contributions of this work is providing two virtual databases that model the evolution of ischemic events, where each model represents <italic>different</italic> physiological conditions. These databases could be used in future studies to find relationships between ionic current variabilities, ischemia and pECG biomarkers.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Variability precludes the classification of ischemia through a single biomarker</title><p>Our results suggest that variability makes it impossible to determine both the presence and severity of ischemia through a simple analysis of the values observed in the pECG biomarkers, which was the first hypothesis of this work. This is a consequence of the additive effect of variability, the ECG signal is produced from the aggregation of the electrical responses of many individual cells, so the relatively small variability observed in cellular biomarkers (i.e. APD90, APA and RMP) is magnified when measuring the ECG biomarkers.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220294.g002">Fig 2</xref>, one can observe that the 1st and 3rd quartiles of the distributions (i.e. the upper and lower limits of the boxplots boxes) of APD90 and RMP showed no overlap. Hence, the different ischemic severities could be classified, at the cellular level, by means of thresholds; but these measurements are not routinely made in patients. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220294.g004">Fig 4</xref> shows that all the measured pECG biomarkers presented overlap in the 1st and 3rd quartiles when comparing <italic>Control</italic> to <italic>Mild</italic> or <italic>Mild</italic> to <italic>Severe</italic>. So, it is concluded that the additive effect of variabilities makes it difficult to draw the lines that classify between the different populations. For example, QRS complex prolongation was observed in some <italic>Mild</italic> ischemic pECG signals, but the same effect was only observed in <italic>Severe</italic> cases of other models. This early QRS complex prolongation was observed in models that had a weak <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Na</italic></sub> and/or <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>CaL</italic></sub> in their <italic>Control</italic> values. These can be regarded as examples of particularly vulnerable patients in which a clinician might have mistakenly diagnosed a Severe ischemic event when, in reality, it was Mild. If, alternatively, the <italic>Mild</italic> models were used as the classification gold-standard, all other patients would be diagnosed late.</p><p>An additional source for variability, that confuses the classification of ischemic events, can be observed in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220294.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220294.g007">7</xref>. The biomarkers that measured the QRS complex behaved linearly whilst the ones that measured the T wave behaved parabolically with respect to the size of the ischemic region. These behaviors emerged because the QRS complex mainly depends on the velocity of the depolarizing wave, and the larger the ischemic region, the greater is the fiber&#x02019;s depolarization time. Alternatively, the differences in T wave morphology are produced by the dyssynchrony in the repolarization of the cells along the fiber, so the fibers where repolarization was more homogeneous (i.e. those where the ischemic and non-ischemic regions had similar size) had similar T wave markers.</p><p>One can observe, from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220294.g005">Fig 5</xref>, that inter-subject variability did not preclude a threshold-based classification when analyzing the ratio of change in the biomarkers; this is because the ratio of change is a more complex feature than the magnitude and, consequently, carries more information. Nevertheless, this did not resolve the problem of determining if the pECG that was being observed corresponded to a healthy heart or to a diseased one. Also, using the ratio of change makes it necessary to have control values for a patient so one can determine if the biomarker has changed and, intuitively, determining a baseline value for a patient is not at all trivial. Furthermore, the variability introduced by considering a variable size for the ischemic region still made it impossible to define clear thresholds or rules, even when assessing the the ratio of change in the biomarkers (see Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220294.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220294.g007">7</xref>).</p><p>It is important to highlight that in the simplified case of a homogeneous cable of cells, the features measured in the pECG are a direct consequence of those measured in the individual cells. For example, the QRS duration is simply an inverse measure of the conduction velocity and the QRS amplitude is a result of combining the APA and the CV. However, once the ischemic formulation is included, this analysis does not hold anymore. This is particularly evident from the different behaviors observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220294.g006">Fig 6</xref>, where the size and severity of the ischemic region introduce non-linear relationships in the behavior of the pECG. Consequently, classification of ischemia becomes no longer trivial. Another key contribution of this paper is to present, through the use of pseudo-ECGs, that the variability originated at the cellular level is amplified when measuring ECG biomarkers, so simple threshold rules and visual inspection of signals will, invariably, result in poor detection and classification performance.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Machine learning is effective in detecting and classifying ischemic events</title><p>On the one hand, the logistic regression classifiers, used as baseline, had poor performance in classifying <italic>Control</italic> or <italic>Mild</italic> models, they were only good when a <italic>Severe</italic> model was presented (please refer to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0220294.s001">S1 File</xref> for details), demonstrating that more advanced classifications algorithms are required. On the other hand, the neural network models produced high performance in all the classification tasks. It can be observed from the two classification paradigms that it was possible to use the pseudo-ECG features to classify the evolution of an ischemic event in a population of fibres. The first proposed approach (multi-class classification) proved to have good performance in assessing the severity of the ischemic event. The second classification topology presented improved performance over the first one, this can be regarded as a consequence of it using more complex features when distinguishing between <italic>Mild</italic> and <italic>Severe</italic> models. Furthermore, the latter topology had added robustness in the detection: if the first network produced a false positive, the second one could filter it by observing no change in the magnitude of the biomarkers, and false negatives were counteracted by the improved sensitivity.</p><p>The main advantage in learning the multi-class classification model is that it does not require patient history and it uses ECG biomarkers that can be easily acquired in a routine visit to the specialist consultant. However, incorrect classification was observed when the network was applied to models that are severe outliers; this was translated in relatively low sensitivity when compared to the second architecture. In the second scheme, the severity of ischemia was assessed by taking into account the changes in biomarkers within the model, hence, it can be regarded as a network that monitors the patient&#x02019;s condition over time. The drawback of the cascade of ANNs is that it requires a history for the patient so that a control set of values can be established; moreover, it is not trivial to establish what this control value should be for a given patient and it is bound to change over time depending on parameters that may be too complex to model (e.g. lifestyle, ageing or co-morbidities).</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Relevance of pECG features in the detection and classification of ischemic events</title><p>Our results suggest that the use of several biomarkers is convenient when detecting and classifying ischemic episodes, as has been highlighted by previous research [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This is mainly because the biomarkers that were relevant for detection were not the same as those relevant for classification.</p><p>Clinical studies have previously shown that QT shortening is observed in the first 12 hours after the onset of acute myocardial infarction [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0220294.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and <xref rid="pone.0220294.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> shows that the classification between <italic>Control</italic> and ischemia is mainly driven by the QT interval. Consequently, the results indicate that QT shortening should be the main cause for alarm in applications that monitor acute myocardial ischemia. However, this feature became less relevant when discerning between the <italic>Mild</italic> and <italic>Severe</italic> ischemic signals. The results indicate that the relative variation in the amplitude of the QRS complex and T waves are the features that will play an important role in determining the severity of the ischemic event. Additionally, in the three networks there were at least three features of equal importance which, combined, were responsible for at least 40% of the classification. This means that even if a &#x02018;heavy&#x02019; feature is absent or mistaken the classification can be made using the other features.</p><p>Interestingly, the gold-standard for ischemia detection (i.e. ST segment deviation) may not be well suited for detecting ischemia at an early stage. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220294.g004">Fig 4</xref> indicates that its value under <italic>Mild</italic> ischemic conditions was similar to that observed in <italic>Control</italic> models and <xref rid="pone.0220294.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> confirms that the ST deviation is the least relevant feature when classifying between the <italic>Control</italic> and the ischemic cases (ANN<sub>21</sub>). Consequently, our results imply that, using the network architectures presented here, ST deviation only becomes relevant in the later stages of acute ischemia, when discerning between the <italic>Mild</italic> and <italic>Severe</italic> ischemic cases.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>A framework for testing proof-of-concept ischemia-detection methods</title><p>An additional contribution of this work was to prove that non linear functions constructed using machine learning techniques are capable of producing high classification and detection performance in an environment plagued by inter-subject variability. This has validated the use of the presented neural network architectures as a proof-of-concept for the early detection of ischemic events. Given the results, we can hypothesize that classification using machine learning models would be beneficial to the diagnosis and classification of acute myocardial ischemia. Indeed, the results shown in Tables <xref rid="pone.0220294.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0220294.t005" ref-type="table">5</xref> indicate that the AI models are capable of learning which pECG features are more relevant for the classification of the signal and, consequently, are capable of performing the task with higher accuracy.</p><p>The results presented here are still far from being applied in clinical practice. However, the results presented in this publication could be used as a guide for future works that may bring this approach closer to the clinic. As shown by the results, determining a patient-specific baseline value for ECG biomarkers should be the matter of further research because it could dramatically improve the detection of early-stage ischemia; indeed, the use of these, more complex, features enabled a significant increase in performance when compared to the multi-class classifier. Also, our results indicate that QT interval and QRS duration are more relevant for the detection of acute ischemic events; then, further studies should focus on further exploting these results and, subsequently, on making robust detection methods for these features because they are most-likely to have an impact on the AI models&#x02019; decision process. Finally, this study supports the use of computational, population-based, methods for testing proof-of-concept classification models when there are few data available and the introduction of machine learning techniques to aid clinicians when diagnostic methods are highly affected by inter-subject variability.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Limitations</title><p>It is important to acknowledge that a 1D cable model entails a number of limitations because one is neglecting the effects of the 3D geometry, particular Purkinje activation sequences, the effects of chest anatomy, and so on. However, simplifying the pECG calculation to a 1D cable is necessary this case to make the population study tractable (i.e. simulating thousands of different ischemic conditions is currently impossible to perform, tractably, in a full-heart geometry). Also, the simplification of a homogeneous cable for the &#x0201c;healthy&#x0201d; case is necessary because of the nature of the mathematical models used. Both the TP and ORd models distinguish the epi, endo and M cells only by variations of their parameters. Since the ePoM explores variability through a variation of the parameters of the models, making a heterogeneous cable of cells may produce undesired confounding factors (e.g. ending up with epicardial cells at the beginning of the cable or with endocardial cells at the end). Given that the purpose of this study is to validate the use of computational models as a means to train machine learning algorithms, the aforementioned limitations are justifiable in this context.</p><p>Previous works have shown that the pseudo-ECG is capable of simulating real-life physiology and pathology [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0220294.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0220294.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], however, there are still some limitations concerning the clinical translation of the results presented in this work. First, the use of fibres of cells instead of whole-heart models means that the results obtained in this paper do not account for certain phenomena that can be observed in an ischemic heart; e.g. re-entrant circuits that lead to arrhythmia, changes in the direction of electrical propagation because of conduction block in the ischemic zone, patient-specific Purkinje activation sequences, 3D geometry-related variability and variations in the ECG depending on the position of the affected area and the characteristics of the patient&#x02019;s torso. Second, the computational study gives the advantage of a noise-free environment that makes it simple to measure the pECG features; in a real-life acquisition, the quality of the acquired signal, and of the denoising techniques, will play an important role in measuring the biomarkers and is expected to have an impact in the performance of the machine learning models.</p><p>Also, an additional limitation is that, since only the last beat of each model is used, temporal variations in the ECG (e.g. due to cell-to-cell uncoupling) are not accounted for when training the machine learning methods; these could play an important role in the generalization of the models. Moreover, the results revealed that the relative variation in amplitude of the QRS complex and T wave are important to determine the severity of the ischemic event, but in patients this variation may be due to a change in thoracic morphology (e.g. because of weight loss/gain) instead of a pathological variation. Additionally, the only consequence of CHD that we can model nowadays is ischemia, which is not always present in CHD; further research is required if we hope to use approaches like the one shown here to detect every possible CHD case.</p><p>Finally, only Deep Learning algorithms were used for classification; although these are known to be universal approximators [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and optimal classifiers [<xref rid="pone.0220294.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], their interpretability is limited. Other ML approaches that may be more interpretable (e.g. Bayesian methods, support vector machines, decision trees) could be tested and their performance compared. These limitations will be addressed in future works, where real-life ECG databases will be used in concert with the simulated data presented here to validate these results and to create robust systems for the detection and assessment of severity of ischemic events.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec022"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This paper has presented the creation of two virtual databases that contain models which capture the evolution of ischemic events in cardiac cells and include inter-subject variability. The databases were constructed using &#x02018;experimentally-calibrated populations of models&#x02019;. Furthermore, these virtual databases were used to train machine learning algorithms capable of detecting and classifying ischemic events with high performance. The entries of the databases include single cell <italic>Control</italic>, <italic>Mild</italic> ischemic and <italic>Severe</italic> ischemic models and cable <italic>Control</italic>, <italic>Mild</italic> ischemic and <italic>Severe</italic> ischemic models with varying sizes of the ischemic region. The study presented in this paper represents progress in the use of experimentally-calibrated populations of models as a means to investigate coronary heart disease. Four key contributions can be highlighted from this work. (1) The study on variability presented here would have been impossible to perform clinically; finding healthy individuals exemplifying all the physiological conditions contained in the <italic>Control</italic> ePoMs is unfeasible and inducing ischemia in these patients is unethical. (2) This paper has shown that the additive effect of variability precludes the detection and classification of ischemic events using simple thresholds or visual inspection; non-linear classifiers, capable of automatically assessing ECG signals, must be introduced as a means to help clinicians when diagnosing coronary heart disease. (3) Our results have shown that machine learning techniques could be a valid tool to solve the aforementioned challenge and have validated two different proof-of-concept neural network architectures that could be used in a future clinical study. (4) The analysis of the different neural network topologies revealed that the biomarkers that better detect ischemia and those that better assess its severity are different, so a multi-biomarker analysis is essential; in particular, future clinical studies should focus on how to determine a <italic>Control</italic> value for the biomarkers because calculating their ratio of change can significantly improve ECG classification. The synthetic databases and machine learning methods presented here form an important precedent because they can be used as a step prior to a clinical study where significant challenges may arise and identifying the sources for errors may be more complicated. The use of virtual databases to explore the effects of ischemia on cardiac cells and to validate proof-of-concept models for the early detection of coronary heart disease could give valuable information prior to a clinical study, thus saving time and speeding-up the applicaton&#x02019;s development process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0220294.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Training algorithm.</title><p>Contains the details of the training algorithm and the performance of all the tested network topologies.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0220294.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0220294.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Supplementary figures.</title><p>Contains the figures that complement the presented results and further support the discussion.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0220294.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>CL and VD received funding from the European Union&#x02019;s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 642612 under the VPH-CaSE ITN framework (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://vph-case.eu">http://vph-case.eu</ext-link>).
