Title: Mal-Prec: computational prediction of protein Malonylation sites via machine learning based feature integration : Malonylation site prediction.

Abstract: <h4>Background</h4>Malonylation is a recently discovered post-translational modification that is associated with a variety of diseases such as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and different types of cancers. Compared with experimental identification of malonylation sites, computational method is a time-effective process with comparatively low costs.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we proposed a novel computational model called Mal-Prec (Malonylation Prediction) for malonylation site prediction through the combination of Principal Component Analysis and Support Vector Machine. One-hot encoding, physio-chemical properties, and composition of k-spaced acid pairs were initially performed to extract sequence features. PCA was then applied to select optimal feature subsets while SVM was adopted to predict malonylation sites. Five-fold cross-validation results showed that Mal-Prec can achieve better prediction performance compared with other approaches. AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curves) analysis achieved 96.47 and 90.72% on 5-fold cross-validation of independent data sets, respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Mal-Prec is a computationally reliable method for identifying malonylation sites in protein sequences. It outperforms existing prediction tools and can serve as a useful tool for identifying and discovering novel malonylation sites in human proteins. Mal-Prec is coded in MATLAB and is publicly available at https://github.com/flyinsky6/Mal-Prec , together with the data sets used in this study.
