Title: iTTCA-RF: a random forest predictor for tumor T cell antigens.

Abstract: <h4>Background</h4>Cancer is one of the most serious diseases threatening human health. Cancer immunotherapy represents the most promising treatment strategy due to its high efficacy and selectivity and lower side effects compared with traditional treatment. The identification of tumor T cell antigens is one of the most important tasks for antitumor vaccines development and molecular function investigation. Although several machine learning predictors have been developed to identify tumor T cell antigen, more accurate tumor T cell antigen identification by existing methodology is still challenging.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, we used a non-redundant dataset of 592 tumor T cell antigens (positive samples) and 393 tumor T cell antigens (negative samples). Four types feature encoding methods have been studied to build an efficient predictor, including amino acid composition, global protein sequence descriptors and grouped amino acid and peptide composition. To improve the feature representation ability of the hybrid features, we further employed a two-step feature selection technique to search for the optimal feature subset. The final prediction model was constructed using random forest algorithm.<h4>Results</h4>Finally, the top 263 informative features were selected to train the random forest classifier for detecting tumor T cell antigen peptides. iTTCA-RF provides satisfactory performance, with balanced accuracy, specificity and sensitivity values of 83.71%, 78.73% and 88.69% over tenfold cross-validation as well as 73.14%, 62.67% and 83.61% over independent tests, respectively. The online prediction server was freely accessible at http://lab.malab.cn/~acy/iTTCA .<h4>Conclusions</h4>We have proven that the proposed predictor iTTCA-RF is superior to the other latest models, and will hopefully become an effective and useful tool for identifying tumor T cell antigens presented in the context of major histocompatibility complex class I.
