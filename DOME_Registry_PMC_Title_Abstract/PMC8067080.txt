Title: The Budapest Amyloid Predictor and Its Applications.

Abstract: The amyloid state of proteins is widely studied with relevance to neurology, biochemistry, and biotechnology. In contrast with nearly amorphous aggregation, the amyloid state has a well-defined structure, consisting of parallel and antiparallel β-sheets in a periodically repeated formation. The understanding of the amyloid state is growing with the development of novel molecular imaging tools, like cryogenic electron microscopy. Sequence-based amyloid predictors were developed, mainly using artificial neural networks (ANNs) as the underlying computational technique. From a good neural-network-based predictor, it is a very difficult task to identify the attributes of the input amino acid sequence, which imply the decision of the network. Here, we present a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based predictor for hexapeptides with correctness higher than 84%, i.e., it is at least as good as the best published ANN-based tools. Unlike artificial neural networks, the decisions of the linear SVMs are much easier to analyze and, from a good predictor, we can infer rich biochemical knowledge. In the Budapest Amyloid Predictor webserver the user needs to input a hexapeptide, and the server outputs a prediction for the input plus the 6 × 19 = 114 distance-1 neighbors of the input hexapeptide.
