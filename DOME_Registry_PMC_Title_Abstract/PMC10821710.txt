Title: MMV_Im2Im: an open-source microscopy machine vision toolbox for image-to-image transformation.

Abstract: Over the past decade, deep learning (DL) research in computer vision has been growing rapidly, with many advances in DL-based image analysis methods for biomedical problems. In this work, we introduce MMV_Im2Im, a new open-source Python package for image-to-image transformation in bioimaging applications. MMV_Im2Im is designed with a generic image-to-image transformation framework that can be used for a wide range of tasks, including semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, image restoration, image generation, and so on. Our implementation takes advantage of state-of-the-art machine learning engineering techniques, allowing researchers to focus on their research without worrying about engineering details. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MMV_Im2Im on more than 10 different biomedical problems, showcasing its general potentials and applicabilities. For computational biomedical researchers, MMV_Im2Im provides a starting point for developing new biomedical image analysis or machine learning algorithms, where they can either reuse the code in this package or fork and extend this package to facilitate the development of new methods. Experimental biomedical researchers can benefit from this work by gaining a comprehensive view of the image-to-image transformation concept through diversified examples and use cases. We hope this work can give the community inspirations on how DL-based image-to-image transformation can be integrated into the assay development process, enabling new biomedical studies that cannot be done only with traditional experimental assays. To help researchers get started, we have provided source code, documentation, and tutorials for MMV_Im2Im at [https://github.com/MMV-Lab/mmv_im2im] under MIT license.
