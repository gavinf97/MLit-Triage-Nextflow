Title: Cross talk of chromosome instability, CpG island methylator phenotype and mismatch repair in colorectal cancer.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer is a severe cancer associated with a high prevalence and fatality rate. There are three major mechanisms for colorectal cancer: (1) Chromosome instability (CIN), (2) CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) and (3) mismatch repair (MMR), of which CIN is the most common type. However, these subtypes are not exclusive and overlap. To investigate their biological mechanisms and cross talk, the gene expression profiles of 585 colorectal cancer patients with CIN, CIMP and MMR status records were collected. By comparing the CIN+ and CIN-samples, CIMP+ and CIMP-samples, MMR+ and MMR-samples with minimal redundancy maximal relevance (mRMR) and incremental feature selection (IFS) methods, the CIN, CIMP and MMR associated genes were selected. Unfortunately, there was little direct overlap among them. To investigate their indirect interactions, downstream genes of CIN, CIMP and MMR were identified using the random walk with restart (RWR) method and a greater overlap of downstream genes was indicated. The common downstream genes were involved in biosynthetic and metabolic pathways. These findings were consistent with the clinical observation of wide range metabolite aberrations in colorectal cancer. To conclude, the present study gave a gene level explanation of CIN, CIMP and MMR, but also showed the network level cross talk of CIN, CIMP and MMR. The common genes of CIN, CIMP and MMR may be useful for cross-subtype general colorectal cancer drug development.
