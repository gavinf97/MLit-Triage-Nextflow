Title: Intratumoral and Peritumoral Radiomics of Contrast-Enhanced CT for Prediction of Disease-Free Survival and Chemotherapy Response in Stage II/III Gastric Cancer.

Abstract: <h4>Background</h4>We evaluated the ability of radiomics based on intratumoral and peritumoral regions on preoperative gastric cancer (GC) contrast-enhanced CT imaging to predict disease-free survival (DFS) and chemotherapy response in stage II/III GC.<h4>Methods</h4>This study enrolled of 739 consecutive stage II/III GC patients. Within the intratumoral and peritumoral regions of CT images, 584 total radiomic features were computed at the portal venous-phase. A radiomics signature (RS) was generated by using support vector machine (SVM) based methods. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to determine the association of the RS and clinicopathological variables with DFS. A radiomics nomogram combining the radiomics signature and clinicopathological findings was constructed for individualized DFS estimation.<h4>Results</h4>The radiomics signature consisted of 26 features and was significantly associated with DFS in both the training and validation sets (both <i>P</i><0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed that the RS was an independent predictor of DFS. The signature had a higher predictive accuracy than TNM stage and single radiomics features and clinicopathological factors. Further analysis showed that stage II/III patients with high scores were more likely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The newly developed radiomics signature was a powerful predictor of DFS in GC, and it may predict which patients with stage II and III GC benefit from chemotherapy.
