Title: COVID-19 Screening in Chest X-Ray Images Using Lung Region Priors.

Abstract: Early screening of COVID-19 is essential for pandemic control, and thus to relieve stress on the health care system. Lung segmentation from chest X-ray (CXR) is a promising method for early diagnoses of pulmonary diseases. Recently, deep learning has achieved great success in supervised lung segmentation. However, how to effectively utilize the lung region in screening COVID-19 still remains a challenge due to domain shift and lack of manual pixel-level annotations. We hereby propose a multi-appearance COVID-19 screening framework by using lung region priors derived from CXR images. Firstly, we propose a multi-scale adversarial domain adaptation network (MS-AdaNet) to boost the cross-domain lung segmentation task as the prior knowledge to the classification network. Then, we construct a multi-appearance network (MA-Net), which is composed of three sub-networks to realize multi-appearance feature extraction and fusion using lung region priors. At last, we can obtain prediction results from normal, viral pneumonia, and COVID-19 using the proposed MA-Net. We extend the proposed MS-AdaNet for lung segmentation task on three different public CXR datasets. The results suggest that the MS-AdaNet outperforms contrastive methods in cross-domain lung segmentation. Moreover, experiments reveal that the proposed MA-Net achieves accuracy of 98.83 % and F1-score of 98.71 % on COVID-19 screening. The results indicate that the proposed MA-Net can obtain significant performance on COVID-19 screening.
