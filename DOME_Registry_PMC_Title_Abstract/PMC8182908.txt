Title: Predicting anticancer hyperfoods with graph convolutional networks.

Abstract: <h4>Background</h4>Recent efforts in the field of nutritional science have allowed the discovery of disease-beating molecules within foods based on the commonality of bioactive food molecules to FDA-approved drugs. The pioneering work in this field used an unsupervised network propagation algorithm to learn the systemic-wide effect on the human interactome of 1962 FDA-approved drugs and a supervised algorithm to predict anticancer therapeutics using the learned representations. Then, a set of bioactive molecules within foods was fed into the model, which predicted molecules with cancer-beating potential.The employed methodology consisted of disjoint unsupervised feature generation and classification tasks, which can result in sub-optimal learned drug representations with respect to the classification task. Additionally, due to the disjoint nature of the tasks, the employed approach proved cumbersome to optimize, requiring testing of thousands of hyperparameter combinations and significant computational resources.To overcome the technical limitations highlighted above, we represent each drug as a graph (human interactome) with its targets as binary node features on the graph and formulate the problem as a graph classification task. To solve this task, inspired by the success of graph neural networks in graph classification problems, we use an end-to-end graph neural network model operating directly on the graphs, which learns drug representations to optimize model performance in the prediction of anticancer therapeutics.<h4>Results</h4>The proposed model outperforms the baseline approach in the anticancer therapeutic prediction task, achieving an F1 score of 67.99%±2.52% and an AUPR of 73.91%±3.49%. It is also shown that the model is able to capture knowledge of biological pathways to predict anticancer molecules based on the molecules' effects on cancer-related pathways.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We introduce an end-to-end graph convolutional model to predict cancer-beating molecules within food. The introduced model outperforms the existing baseline approach, and shows interpretability, paving the way to the future of a personalized nutritional science approach allowing the development of nutrition strategies for cancer prevention and/or therapeutics.
