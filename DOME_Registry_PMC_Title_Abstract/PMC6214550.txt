Title: Predicting bacterial growth conditions from mRNA and protein abundances.

Abstract: Cells respond to changing nutrient availability and external stresses by altering the expression of individual genes. Condition-specific gene expression patterns may thus provide a promising and low-cost route to quantifying the presence of various small molecules, toxins, or species-interactions in natural environments. However, whether gene expression signatures alone can predict individual environmental growth conditions remains an open question. Here, we used machine learning to predict 16 closely-related growth conditions using 155 datasets of E. coli transcript and protein abundances. We show that models are able to discriminate between different environmental features with a relatively high degree of accuracy. We observed a small but significant increase in model accuracy by combining transcriptome and proteome-level data, and we show that measurements from stationary phase cells typically provide less useful information for discriminating between conditions as compared to exponentially growing populations. Nevertheless, with sufficient training data, gene expression measurements from a single species are capable of distinguishing between environmental conditions that are separated by a single environmental variable.
